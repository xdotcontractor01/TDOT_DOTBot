If there is a discrepancy between Unit Bid Prices and extensions, the Unit Bid Price shall govern in accordance with Subsection 102.06. In determining Unit Bid Prices, fractional parts of a cent less than 1/1000 cent ($0.001) will not be considered significant and will be dropped.

Until the final Award of the Contract, however, the right will be reserved to reject any and all Proposals, to waive technicalities, to advertise for new Proposals, or to proceed to do the work otherwise if the interest of the Department will be promoted thereby.

If, prior to the award of a contract, the low bidder discovers that an obvious error was made in the preparation of the bid, a request to the Department may be made to allow the withdrawal of the bid without bid bond forfeiture. The decision whether or not to grant such a request rests entirely with the Department and at the discretion of the Department. If such a request is granted, the Department may, at its discretion, award the contract to the next lowest reliable bidder, re-advertise, perform the work itself, or abandon the project.

# 103.2 Award of Contract

Single as well as multiple proposals for a project will be publicly opened and read. If only one proposal is received on a project and the amount of that proposal is equal to or less than the Department’s cost estimate for the project, as certified by the Chief Engineer, the cost estimate will be read. Posting of a bid on the department's website shall be equivalent to having read the bid.

If only one proposal is received and the amount of that proposal exceeds the Department’s cost estimate for the project, the Department may, at its option, award the contract, or reject the proposal and re-advertise, perform the work itself, or abandon the project.

The Award of Contracts involving work financed entirely or in part by Federal funds is conditioned upon the concurrence of the Federal agency involved. No bids will be negotiated or adjusted.

Award to the successful bidder will be made public through the publication of the Award Announcement. If the successful bidder fails to execute the Contract and file acceptable bonds within the period set forth in Subsection 103.07 thereby causing cancellation of the award and forfeiture of the Proposal Guaranty, the Department may award the Contract to the next lowest reliable bidder, re-advertise, abandon the project, or perform the work itself.

Should any construction or conditions not thoroughly or satisfactorily stipulated and set forth by the Standard Specifications and Supplements thereto be anticipated on any proposed work, Special Provisions for such work will be included in the Proposal and the Contract as a part thereof. Should any such Special Provisions contain requirements in conflict with the Standard Specifications and Supplements thereto, the Special Provisions will govern.

# 104.03 Alteration of Plans or Character of Work

# A. Authority to Make Changes

The Department reserves the right to make, at any time during the progress of the work, such increases or decreases in quantities and such alterations in the details of construction, including alterations in the grade or alignment of the road or structure or both, as may be found necessary or desirable. Such increases or decreases and alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release the Surety, and the Contractor agrees to perform The Work as altered, the same as if it had been a part of the original Contract.

Whenever an alteration in character of work involves a substantial change in the nature of the design or in the type of construction or materially increases or decreases the cost of performance, a Supplemental Agreement acceptable to both parties shall be executed before work is started on such alteration, except that in the absence of a Supplemental Agreement acceptable to both parties, the Engineer may direct that the work be done by Force Account. Any Force Account Agreement shall be in writing, specifying the terms of payment, signed by the State Construction Engineer and agreed to in writing by the Contractor.

All work shall be performed as directed and in accordance with the Specifications.

# B. No Waiver of Contract

Changes made by the Engineer will not be considered to waive any of the provisions of the Contract, nor may the Contractor make any claim for loss of anticipated profits because of the changes, or by reason of any variation between the approximate quantities and the quantities of work as done.

# C. Certain Items Not Limited

The quantities of all types of excavation, embankment when a Pay Item, perforated underdrain pipe, ditch paving, subgrade treatment materials, stabilizers, extra depth of concrete including its reinforcement, piling, guard rail, asphaltic concrete leveling, erosion control items, traffic control items, slope paving, bridge rip-rap, filter fabric, or any other items that cannot conveniently be determined accurately until after The Work is in progress, and any increase or decrease in these quantities, whatever the amount, will be considered normal overruns or underruns. The Engineer has unlimited authority to increase or decrease these quantities.

# D. Changes in Other Quantities

The Engineer may increase or decrease the quantities of any and all other Pay Items, without changing the Unit Prices Bid, provided that the sum total of such changes, exclusive of changes in those items covered in Subsection 104.03.C, does not increase or decrease the original Contract amount by more than 20 percent.

Section 104 – Scope of Work

E. Changes to Original Length or Cost of Project

The Engineer has the authority to extend or reduce the total length or total cost of the Project by as much as 20 percent. The provisions of Subsection 104.03.C, covering overruns or underruns of certain Pay Items apply also to overruns or underruns in quantities resulting from an extension or reduction in the length of the Project. If the Project is extended in length, an Extension Agreement will be executed. If the Extension Agreement calls for Pay Items already in the Contract, the Unit Prices for such Items will not be changed except as provided in Subsections 104.03.A, 104.03.B and 104.03.D. New work for which no Unit Prices have been Bid will be paid for as Extra Work as defined in Subsection 104.04.

F. Railroad Grade Separation Structures

Changes in design or construction features of railroad grade separation structures must be submitted to the Engineer of the railroad for approval. The Department will diligently expedite all correspondence with the railroad officials but will not be responsible to the Contractor for any delay to the Contractor’s work resulting from delay in securing the necessary approval. The Engineer will give due consideration to such delays in determining the time for completion of the Contract.

# 104.04 Extra Work

The Contractor shall perform unforeseen work, for which there is no price included in the Contract, whenever it is necessary or desirable in order to complete fully the work as contemplated. Such work shall be performed in accordance with the Specifications and as directed and will be paid for as provided in Subsection 109.05.

# 104.05 Maintenance During Construction

A. Contractor Maintenance

The Contractor shall maintain the Project from the beginning of construction operations until maintenance acceptance or final acceptance of the Project, except as otherwise provided in Subsection 104.05.B. This maintenance shall constitute continuous and effective work prosecuted day by day with adequate equipment and forces to the end that the roadway or structures are kept in satisfactory condition at all times. This includes signing, pavement markings, and traffic control devices as outlined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, Section 150, Project Plans and Special Provisions for Traffic Control. All existing guard rail, signs, pavement, pavement markings, bridge handrail, and other safety appurtenances shall also be maintained in a safe and satisfactory condition.

The Contractor shall not allow vegetative growth at any time to obstruct signs, delineation, traffic movements, or sight distance. The Contractor shall, at intervals not to exceed 6 months, clean up and remove litter and debris; remove all weeds from around guard rail, barrier, poles, standards, utility facilities, and other structures; and cut or trim trees, bushes, or tall grass. These requirements shall apply to all areas within the project termini and lateral limits.

For projects or segments of projects with staging which requires that traffic be maintained through the project limits during the prosecution of the work, the Contractor shall assume all responsibility for damage to the work until either maintenance acceptance or final acceptance of the section or Project.

On projects constructed with traffic relocated to an alternate roadway or projects constructed on new location, the Contractor shall be responsible for all damage to the work until the Department directs that the Project be opened to traffic. At that time the Contractor will no longer be responsible for traffic related damage to the work other than that attributable to the Contractor’s actions or inadequate construction. The Department may direct, however, that traffic-related damage be repaired at existing unit prices or as extra work as provided for in Subsection 104.04.

Section 104 – Scope of Work

B. Maintenance of Traffic During Suspension of Work

During any suspension of work ordered by the Engineer, the Contractor shall make passable and shall open to traffic such portions of the project and temporary roadways, special detours, or portions thereof as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Engineer for the temporary accommodation of necessary traffic during the anticipated period of suspension. Thereafter, and until issuance of an order for the resumption of construction operations, the maintenance of the temporary route or line of travel agreed upon will be by and at the expense of the Department. When work is resumed, the Contractor shall replace or renew any work or materials lost or damaged because of such temporary use of the project; shall remove to the extent directed by the Engineer any work or materials used in the temporary maintenance thereof by the Department; and shall complete the project in every respect as though its prosecution had been continuous and without interferences. All additional work caused by such suspensions, for reasons beyond the control of the Contractor, will be paid for by the Department at Contract prices or by Force Account.

C. Maintenance Directed by The Engineer

If the Engineer directs special maintenance for the benefit of the traveling public, the Contractor will be paid on the basis of Unit Prices or under Subsection 104.04. The Engineer will be the sole judge of work to be classed as special maintenance.

D. Detours Outside Right-of-Way

The Department will be responsible for the construction and maintenance of detours outside the right-of-way except where otherwise provided for in the Contract.

E. Special Detours

When the Proposal contains Bid Items which provide for construction, maintenance, and removal of detour bridges or roads, the payment for such items shall cover all cost of constructing and maintaining such detour or detours, including the construction of any and all temporary bridges and accessory features and the removal of the same, and obliteration of the detour road, except as otherwise provided in Subsection 104.05.B. Right-of-Way for temporary highways or bridges called for under this Subsection will be furnished by the Department.

F. Delays to Traffic

Two-way traffic shall be maintained at all times, unless otherwise approved. The Contractor shall not stop traffic without permission of the Engineer.

# Section 104 – Scope of Work

# 104.06 Right in and Use of Materials Found on the Project

Materials that have salvage value, as determined by the Engineer, shall remain the property of the Department and shall be utilized as directed by the Engineer. The Contractor, with the approval of the Engineer, may use on the project such materials as may be found on the project, and will be paid at the bid price for removal of the material. If the materials, after processing, are suitable for other items of work, the Contractor will also be paid for those items in which the material is incorporated except as otherwise provided for in these specifications. He shall replace at his own expense with other acceptable material all of that portion of the materials so removed and used which was needed for use in the embankments, backfills, approaches, or otherwise, including proper allowance for swell when applicable.

When existing materials found on the project, such as crushed stone base, are to be reused directly in the work, the Contractor will not be paid the full Contract Price for the Item, but will be paid at the Contract Price minus the equivalent cost of new materials. The Contractor shall not excavate or remove any material without written authorization from the Engineer. The Contractor shall not make any claim upon the State for damages or loss of anticipated profits because of the expected use of any materials indicated on the Plans as existing and later found to be nonexistent or unfit for use.

The Department does not warrant or guarantee the existence, quality, or quantity of materials indicated as existing on the Plans. If any sales tax is involved in materials found on the right-of-way and sold by the Contractor, the Contractor will be responsible for paying same.

Unless otherwise provided, the material from any existing old structure may be used temporarily by the Contractor in the erection of the new structure. Such material shall not be cut or otherwise damaged except with the approval of the Engineer. Any material used by the Contractor and damaged during use shall be replaced at the Contractor’s expense.

# 104.07 Final Cleaning Up

Before final acceptance, the highway borrow pits and all ground occupied by the Contractor in connection with the work shall be cleaned of all rubbish, excess materials, temporary structures, and equipment. All weeds and high grass shall be cut and disposed of. The right-of-way shall be mown when directed by the Engineer in accordance with Subsection 700.3.07. All parts of the Work shall be left in an acceptable condition.

The disposal adjacent to the right-of-way of materials cleaned from the right-of-way will not be permitted, even with the permission of the property owner. Temporary buildings or other structures built for the Contractor’s use and located within view of the right-of-way, constituting a hazard or making an unsightly appearance, shall be removed and disposed of as directed.

On specialty-type Contracts where the entire work consists of such specialty items as resurfacing, fencing, stripe painting, signing, highway lighting, and the like, the Contractor will not be required to clean up the right-of-way beyond the limits of construction, unless such clean up work is included in the Contract as a Pay Item. However, he shall remove all of his own property and leave the remaining right-of-way in a condition at least as good as it was before the work was begun.

As to compliance or non-compliance with these provisions, as well as the obligations of the Contractor in relation thereto, the decision of the Chief Engineer shall be final and conclusive.

# Section 104 – Scope of Work

# 104.08 Value Engineering Proposals

# A. Applicability

This Section applies to those cost reduction proposals initiated and developed by the Contractor for changing the
Plans, Specifications, or other requirements of the Contract. These provisions do not apply unless the proposal
submitted by the Contractor is specifically identified as being presented as a Value Engineering Proposal (VEP)
and the Contract amount is in excess of $50,000.

The cost-reduction Proposals contemplated are those discretionary changes which would require a Supplemental
Agreement modifying the Contract and would produce a savings to the Department by providing less costly items
or methods than those specified in the Contract without impairing essential functions and characteristics
including, but not limited to: service life, reliability, economy of operations, ease of maintenance, and safety, both
during and after construction. Proposals must provide a product comparable to the original design at a lower cost
or improved quality, or both. No proposals will be accepted that lower the quality of the project.
These provisions are applicable to the prime Contract and include all subcontracts.

# B. Documentation

Value Engineering Proposals (VEP) will be processed in the same manner as prescribed for any other alterations of
the Contract requiring a Supplemental Agreement.
As a minimum, the following information shall be submitted by the Contractor with each Value
Engineering Proposal:

1. A description of the difference between the existing Contract requirement and the proposed change and
the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each.
2. An itemization of the requirements of the Contract which must be changed and a recommendation of how to
make such change (e.g., a suggested revision).
3. A detailed estimate of the cost of performing the work under the Contract and under the proposed change.
4. A prediction of any effects the proposed changes would have on other costs to the Department, including
cost of related items and costs of maintenance and operation.
5. A statement of the time showing the last date by which an agreement for adoption of the proposed changes
must be executed in order to obtain the maximum cost reduction during the remainder of the Contract, noting
any effect on the Contract completion time or delivery schedule.
6. The dates of any previous or concurrent submissions of the Proposal, the Contract number(s) under which
submitted, and the outcome or the result of the proposal in previous projects and any previous actions by the
Department, if known.
7. A life-cycle cost analysis.

NOTE: If a VEP is similar to a change in the Plans or Specifications for the Project that is under
consideration by the Department at the time said VEP is submitted, or if such VEP is based upon or
similar to Standard Specifications, Special Provisions, or Standard Plans adopted by the Department
after the advertisement of the Contract, the Engineer will not accept such proposal and the
Department reserves the right to make such changes without compensation to the Contractor under
the provisions of this Section.

Proposed changes in the basic design of a pavement type (e.g., rigid to flexible or vice versa) or
pavement thickness will not be considered as an acceptable VEP. Proposed changes to base/subbase
courses may be considered as an acceptable VEP. If design alternates are shown in the plans, the
Department will not consider a VEP substituting a design alternate on which the Contractor could have
bid for one on which the Contractor has bid. The Department reserves the right to reject any VEP
submitted requiring additional Right-of-Way.

# Section 104 – Scope of Work

# C. Submission

Value Engineering Proposals submitted by the Contractor will be processed as expeditiously as possible; however, the Department will not be liable for any delay in acting upon proposals submitted. The Contractor may withdraw, wholly or in part, any VEP not accepted by the Department within the time specified in Subsection 104.08.B.5.

# D. Acceptance

The decision of the Engineer as to the acceptance or rejection of a VEP shall be final and shall not be subject to the provisions of Subsection 105.13, Claims for Adjustments and Disputes. The Engineer may accept, in whole or in part, before work has been completed, any VEP submitted pursuant to this Subsection and not withdrawn by the Contractor by giving the Contractor written notice thereof reciting acceptance under this Subsection.

# E. Notification

The Contractor will be notified in writing of the Department’s decision or rejection of each VEP submitted under these provisions. If a proposal is accepted, the necessary Contract modifications will be affected by execution of a Supplemental Agreement. Unless and until a VEP is affected by such Supplemental Agreement, the Contractor shall remain obligated to perform The Work in accordance with the terms of the existing Contract. Supplemental Agreements made as a result of this Subsection will state that they are made pursuant to it.

# F. Sharing

In the event a VEP submitted by the Contractor under this Subsection is accepted, the Supplemental Agreement effecting the necessary modifications will establish the net savings agreed upon and will provide for an adjustment in Contract Prices that will divide the net savings between the Contractor and the Department in accordance with the following provisions:

1. Division of net savings in Contract Price Adjustment:
- 50 percent of the net savings to the Contractor.
- 50 percent of the net savings to the Department.
2. The Department reserves the right to include in the agreement any conditions it deems appropriate for consideration, approval, and implementation of the VEP. The Contractor’s 50 percent of the net savings shall constitute the full compensation for effecting all changes pursuant to the agreement. Development costs incurred by the Contractor and review costs incurred by the Department shall not be considered in computing the net savings of the VEP.
3. Restrictions and Disclosures: Upon acceptance and implementation of any VEP, any restrictions imposed by the Contractor on its use or disclosure of the information submitted shall be void. The Department shall thereafter have the right to use, duplicate, and disclose, in whole or in any part, all data necessary in the utilization of the proposal.

Section 105 — Control of Work

# 105.01 Authority of the Engineer

The Engineer will decide all questions that may arise as to the quality and acceptability of materials furnished, work performed, and the rate of progress of the work; the interpretation of the Plans and Specifications, and all questions as to the acceptable fulfillment of the Contract on the part of the Contractor. The Engineer will determine the quantities of the several kinds of work performed and materials furnished which are to be paid for under the Contract and his determination shall be final.

The Engineer will have the authority to suspend the work wholly or in part due to the failure of the Contractor to correct conditions unsafe for the workmen or general public; for failure to carry out provisions of the Contract, or for failure to carry out orders; for such periods as he may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather; for conditions considered unsuitable for the prosecution of the work; or for any other condition or reason deemed to be in the public interest.

The Contractor may request and will receive written instructions from the Engineer upon any important items.

After the Contract has been executed, and before work begins, the Engineer may designate a time and place to hold a Preconstruction Conference with the Contractor. At such time, the Contractor shall furnish the Engineer with a Progress Schedule as provided in Subsection 108.03 unless this schedule has been specifically exempted by Special Provision. The Contractor will also be given a decision on any alternate Traffic Control Plan that he may have previously submitted.

Any matters pertaining to order of work, interpretation of Plans and Specifications, traffic control, utility adjustments, or others, may be discussed at the Preconstruction Conference.

# 105.02 Plans and Working Drawings

Plans will show details of all structures, lines, grades, typical cross sections of the roadway, location and design of all structures, and a summary of Items appearing in the Proposal.

The plans will be supplemented by such working drawings as are necessary to adequately control the work. Working drawings for structures shall be furnished by the Contractor and shall consist of such detailed Plans as may be required to adequately control the work and which are not included in the plans furnished by the Department. They shall include stress sheets, shop drawings, erection plans, falsework plans, cofferdam plans, bending diagrams for reinforcing steel or any other supplementary plans, or similar data required of the Contractor. All working drawings must be approved by the Engineer and such approval shall not operate to relieve the Contractor of any responsibility under the contract for the successful completion of the work. The Contract Bid Prices shall include the cost of furnishing all working drawings.



---


# Section 105 — Control of Work

# 105.03 Conformity with Plans and Specifications

All work performed and all materials furnished shall be in reasonably close conformity with the lines, grades, cross sections, dimensions, and material requirements, including tolerances, shown on the Plans or indicated in the specifications.

Plan dimensions and contract specification values are to be considered as the target values to be strived for and complied with as the design values from which any deviations are allowed. It is the intent of the specifications that the materials and workmanship shall be uniform in character and shall conform as nearly as realistically possible to the prescribed target value or to the middle portion of the tolerance range. The purpose of the tolerance range is to accommodate occasional minor variations from the median zone that are unavoidable for practical reasons. When either a maximum and minimum value or both are specified, the production and processing of the material and the performance of the work shall be so controlled that material or work will not be preponderantly of borderline quality or dimension.

In the event the Engineer finds the materials or the finished product in which the materials are used not within reasonably close conformity with the plans and specifications, but that reasonably acceptable work has been produced, the Engineer shall then make a determination if the work shall be accepted and remain in place. In this event, except in cases where the appropriate price adjustments are provided for in the specifications covering the materials and/or the finished product, a Supplemental Agreement will be executed documenting the basis of acceptance that will provide for an appropriate price adjustment in the Contract Price for such work or materials as the Engineer deems necessary to conform to his determination based on engineering judgement.

In the event the Engineer finds the materials or the finished product in which the materials are used or the work performed are not in reasonably close conformity with the plans and specifications, and have resulted in an inferior or unsatisfactory product, the work or materials shall be removed and replaced or otherwise corrected by and at the expense of the Contractor.

# 105.04 Coordination of Plans, Specifications, Supplemental Specifications, and Special Provisions

These Standard Specifications, the Supplemental Specifications, the Plans, Special Provisions, and all supplementary documents are essential parts of the Contract, and a requirement occurring in one is as binding as though occurring in all. They are intended to be complementary and to describe and provide for a complete work.

In cases of discrepancy, the governing descending order will be as follows:

1. Project Specific Special Provision
2. Project Plans including Special Plan Details
3. Special Provisions
4. Supplemental Specifications
5. Standard Plans including Standard Construction Details
6. Standard Specifications

Calculated dimensions will govern over scaled dimensions.

The Contractor shall take no advantage of any apparent error or omission in the plans or specifications. In the event the Contractor discovers such an error or omission, he shall immediately notify the Engineer. The Engineer will then make such corrections and interpretations as may be deemed necessary for fulfilling the intent of the plans and specifications.



---

Section 105 — Control of Work

# A. Specifications of Other Organizations

When work is specified to be done or when materials are to be furnished according to the published specifications of organizations other than the Department, the latest specifications published by those organizations at the time bids are received shall apply unless otherwise specified. AASHTO Interim Specifications and ASTM Tentative Specifications will be considered effective on date of issue.

# B. Item Numbers

The first three digits of any Item Number in the itemized proposal designates the specification section under which the Item shall be constructed.

# 105.05 Cooperation by Contractor

The Contractor will be supplied with an electronic copy of approved plans and contract assemblies including special provisions. The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining one set of the approved plans on the project site at all times. The Contractor will be supplied with approved plans and contract assemblies including special provisions. The Contractor shall give the work the constant attention necessary to facilitate the progress thereof, and shall cooperate with the Engineer, Inspectors, and other Contractors in every way possible.

The Superintendent shall have full authority to execute orders or directions of the Engineer without delay and to promptly supply such materials, equipment, tools, labor, and incidentals as may be required. Such superintendence shall be furnished irrespective of the amount of work sublet.

The Superintendent shall notify the Engineer prior to starting any Pay Item Work. The Prime Contractor shall coordinate and be responsible to the Engineer for all activities of subcontractors.

# 105.06 Cooperation with Utilities

The Department will notify all utility companies, all pipeline owners, all railroad companies, or other parties affected of Award of the Contract, giving the name and address of the Contractor, and will assist the Contractor in arranging for all necessary adjustments of the public or private utility fixtures, pipe lines, and other appurtenances within or adjacent to the limits of construction.

Water lines, gas lines, wire lines, service connections, water and gas meter boxes, water and gas valve boxes, light standards, cableways, signals, railroad facilities, and all other utility appurtenances within the limits of the proposed construction which are to be relocated or adjusted are to be moved by the owners at their expense, except as otherwise provided for elsewhere in the Contract.

It is understood and agreed that the Contractor has considered in his bid all of the permanent and temporary utility appurtenances in their present location or relocated positions, and that no additional compensation will be allowed for any delays, inconvenience, or damage sustained by him due to any interference from said utility appurtenances or the operation of moving them. Delays and interruptions to the controlling Item or Items of the work are covered in Subsection 107.21.G.

It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to plan with each utility owner a schedule of operations which will clearly set forth at which stage of the Contractor’s operations the utility owner will be required to perform his removal and relocation work.

# 105.07 Cooperation Between Contractors

The Department reserves the right at any time to Contract for and perform other or additional work on or near the work covered by the Contract.

When separate Contracts are let within the limits of any one project, each contractor shall conduct his work so as not to interfere with or hinder the progress or completion of the work being performed by other Contractors. Contractors working on the same project shall cooperate with each other.

Each Contractor involved shall assume all liability, financial or otherwise, in connection with his Contract and shall protect and save harmless the Department from any and all damages or claims that may arise because of inconvenience, delay, or loss experienced by him because of the presence and operations of other Contractors working within the limits of the same project.

The Contractor shall arrange his work and shall place and dispose of the materials being used so as not to interfere with the operations of the other contractors within the limits of the same project. He shall join his work with that of the others in an acceptable manner and shall perform it in proper sequence to that of the others. At the request of the Structure Contractor, the Engineer will designate an area within the right-of-way, adjacent to each structure, to be reserved for use by the Structure Contractor for storage of equipment and materials necessary to construct the particular structure. So long as he occupies this area, the Structure Contractor shall be responsible for its maintenance. The Structure Contractor must relinquish this area, however, as it becomes practical to utilize completed portions of the structure.

All materials and each part of the detail of the work shall be subject to inspection by the Engineer. The Engineer shall be allowed access to all parts of the work and shall be furnished with such information and assistance by the Contractor as is required to make a complete and detailed inspection. Upon the Engineer’s request, the Contractor, at any time before final acceptance of the project, shall remove or uncover such portions of the finished work as may be directed. After examination, the Contractor shall restore said portions of the work to the standard required by the specifications. Should the work thus exposed or examined prove acceptable, the uncovering or removing and the replacing of the covering or making good of the parts removed will be paid for as extra work; but should the work so exposed or examined prove unacceptable, the uncovering, or removing and the replacing of the covering or making good of the parts removed will be at the Contractor’s expense.

Any work done or materials used without supervision or inspection by an authorized Department representative may be ordered removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense, unless the Department representative failed to inspect after having been given reasonable notice in writing that the work was to be performed.

When any unit of government or political subdivision or any railroad corporation is to pay a portion of the cost of the work covered by the Contract, its respective representatives shall have the right to inspect the work. Such inspection shall in no sense make any unit of government or political subdivision or any railroad corporation a party to the Contract and shall in no way interfere with the rights of either party hereunder.

# 105.12 Removal of Unacceptable and Unauthorized Work

All work that does not conform to the requirements of the Contract will be considered unacceptable unless otherwise determined acceptable under the provisions in Subsection 105.03.

Worksheets used to prepare the claim establishing the cost components for items of the claim including, but not limited to, labor, benefits and insurance, materials, equipment, subcontractors, and all documents which establish the time periods, individuals involved, the hours and the rates for the individuals.

# F. Mediation

After compliance by the Contractor with parts B., C., D. and E. of Subsection 105.13 and if the Contractor's claim has been disallowed in whole or in part, then the Contractor may, within 30 calendar days from receipt of the ruling of the Engineer, make a written request to the Engineer that the claim or claims be referred to mediation. If requested in accordance with this specification, mediation shall be granted by the Department. In which case, within 30 days of receipt by the Department of the Contractor's request for mediation, the Contractor and the Department will meet to select a mediator. The mediator will then schedule the mediation at a place, time, and earliest date agreeable to the Contractor and the Department.

The Contractor and the Department mutually agree that mediation shall be a condition precedent to the filing of any lawsuit concerning claims or alleged breaches of the Contract. The costs and expenses of the mediator, selected by mutual agreement of the parties, will be divided equally between the Department and the Contractor. Each party to the mediation shall bear its own costs of preparing for and participating in the mediation.

# G. Remedies Exclusive

In the event any legal action is instituted against the Department by the Contractor on account of any claim for additional compensation, whether on account of delay, acceleration, breach of contract, claimed extra work, or otherwise, the Contractor agrees that the Department's liability will be limited to those items which are specifically identified as payable in Sub-Section 105.13.

# 105.14 Maintenance During Construction

The Contractor shall maintain the project during construction and until the Project is accepted. This maintenance shall constitute the continuous and effective work prosecuted day by day, with adequate equipment and forces to the end that all areas of the project are kept in satisfactory condition at all times.

The Contractor’s area of responsibility for maintenance is confined to the physical construction limits plus any areas affected by the Contractor’s activities. Once maintenance acceptance or final acceptance has been made, the Contractor is no longer responsible for damage to The Work other than that attributable to the Contractor’s actions or inadequate construction.

In case of separate contracts, each Contractor shall be responsible for any damage to the completed work of others caused by his actions or negligence. Where the work of one Contractor has been accepted by the Department, the Contractor performing subsequent work in the area shall be responsible for the maintenance and protection of all work previously completed.

If separate bridge contracts are let within the limits of a Roadway Project and the Bridge Contractor completes his Contract before the Roadway Contractor, the Bridge Contract may be accepted, and the Roadway Contractor will be responsible for maintenance of the new bridge until it is opened to traffic. If the Roadway Contractor hauls materials across the bridge the Roadway Contractor shall protect the end posts, deck surface, deck edges, joints, and all other vulnerable features of the bridge by use of adequate timber or earth cushions as directed by the Engineer. The Roadway Contractor shall repair all damage caused by such use, including resealing of joints and rerubbing of finish at his own expense.

All cost of maintenance work during construction and before the Project is accepted shall be included in the Unit Prices Bid on the various Pay Items and the Contractor will not be paid an additional amount for such work except as provided in Subsection 104.05.B.

The Contractor shall not allow vegetative growth at any time to obstruct signs, delineation, traffic movements, or sight distance. The Contractor shall at intervals not to exceed six months, clean up and remove litter and debris; remove weeds from around guardrail, barrier, poles, standards, utility facilities, and other structures; and cut or trim trees, bushes or tall grass. These requirements shall apply to all areas within the project termini and lateral limits.

# Section 105 — Control of Work

# 105.15 Failure to Maintain Roadway or Structures

If at any time, the Contractor fails to comply with the provisions of Subsection 105.14, the Engineer will immediately notify the Contractor of such noncompliance. If the Contractor fails to remedy the unsatisfactory maintenance within 48 hours after receipt of such notice, the Engineer may immediately proceed to maintain the work, and the entire cost of this maintenance will be deducted from monies due or to become due the Contractor under the Contract. As an alternative to the Engineer’s maintaining the work, all the Items and quantities of work done, but not properly maintained, may be deducted from the current progress estimate, even if such Items have been paid for in a previous estimate.

# 105.16 Final Inspection and Acceptance

# A. Corrective list

Excluding resurfacing projects, no less than 60 (Sixty) calendar days prior to the Contract completion date the Engineer will hold a closing conference and perform an inspection of the Work. Any items found unsatisfactory during this inspection will be detailed as necessary remedial work and provided to the Contractor in the form of a Corrective list. A Corrective list is intended to facilitate timely completion of the work. Resurfacing projects necessitate the Engineer commence a closing conference and inspection no less than 14 calendar days to the Contract completion date unless otherwise arranged and agreed to by the Contractor. The Contractor is encouraged to request additional inspections earlier in the project as major portions of the work appear complete. Production of a Corrective list does not, in any way, represent a Final Inspection having been performed.

# B. Final Inspection

Upon receipt of due written notice from the Contractor of completion of the entire project, the Engineer will schedule and make an inspection for acceptance within 7-business days. No time charges shall be applied to the Contractor for the Engineer’s inability to meet the 7-business day allowance. If all construction provided for and contemplated by the Contract is found completed to the Engineer’s satisfaction and all documents required in connection with the project have been submitted by the Contractor, the Engineer will consider this the Final Inspection. The Engineer will subsequently make the Final Acceptance and notify the Contractor in writing of this acceptance. The Engineer will have the final decision on when the project is complete. If, however, the Inspection discloses any work, in whole or part, as being unsatisfactory, the Engineer will detail the remedial work required to achieve acceptance and provide the Contractor the necessary instructions for correction of same. Only one list of instructions will be generated by the Engineer. The Contractor shall immediately comply with and execute such instructions. Subsequent inspections will be made on the remedial work until the Engineer accepts all work. Such subsequent inspections are only for the purpose of assessing completion of the instructions provided. When all construction provided for and contemplated by the Contract is found completed to the Engineer’s satisfaction, including submission of all documents required in connection with the project with the exception of final documents as defined in Section 108.07, the Engineer will make the Final Acceptance and notify the Contractor in writing of this acceptance. When the Contractor has finished a major portion of the Contract, the Contractor may request that a semi-final inspection be made. At the discretion of the Engineer, who shall be sole judge as to making the inspection, if the work is satisfactory, as described in the first paragraph of this Section, that portion of the Contract may be accepted, opened to traffic, if not already carrying traffic, and the Contractor relieved of the maintenance obligations as described elsewhere in these specifications. Such partial acceptance shall in no way relieve the Contractor of responsibility for satisfactory completion of the Contract, or for failure of any portion of the accepted work prior to Final Acceptance of the project.

Section 106 — Control of Materials

# 106.01 Source of Supply and Quantity of Materials

The materials used in the work shall meet all quality requirements of the Contract. Materials will not be considered as finally accepted until all tests, including any to be taken from the finished Work have been completed and evaluated. To expedite the inspection and testing of materials, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer in writing of his proposed sources of materials at least 2 weeks before delivery, or earlier if blend determinations or mix designs are required. When required, representative preliminary samples of the character and quality prescribed shall be submitted for examination and testing. The approval of preliminary samples does not obligate the Engineer to accept materials from the same source delivered later. If, after trial, it is found that sources of supply for previously approved materials do not produce uniform and satisfactory products, or if the product from any source proves unacceptable at any time, the Contractor shall furnish materials from other sources. The Engineer shall have the right to reject the entire output of any source from which he finds it is impractical to secure a continuous flow of uniformly satisfactory material.

Upon request by the Department, the Contractor shall furnish formal written invoices from the materials suppliers. The invoice shall show the date shipped, the quantities, and the unit prices. The Contractor shall purchase materials from suppliers who are willing for the Contractor to furnish the Department copies of invoices as noted herein upon request by the Department.

Materials used and operations performed under Section 400- Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction, shall be controlled and tested by the Contractor. This shall be done in such a manner as to produce a uniform product that meets Specification requirements. In the event the Contractor’s quality control procedures do not achieve the desired objective, operations shall be suspended until satisfactory results are obtained. The Contractor’s quality control personnel shall be properly instructed and trained to perform all tests and make calculations and shall be competent to control all processes so that the requirements are met.

# 106.02 Unacceptable Material

All material not conforming to the requirements of the specifications will be considered as unacceptable. All unacceptable materials, whether in place or not, will be rejected and shall be removed immediately from the site of the work unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. In case of failure by the Contractor to comply promptly with any order by the Engineer to remove rejected materials, the Engineer shall have authority to have such rejected materials removed by other means and to deduct the expense of such removal from any monies due, or to become due, to the Contractor. No rejected materials, the defects of which have been corrected, shall be used until the Engineer has given approval.

# 106.03 Samples, Tests, Cited Specifications

All materials will be inspected, tested, and approved by the Engineer before incorporation into the work. Samples will be taken by a qualified representative of the Department. Unless otherwise designated, tests will be made by and at the expense of the Department and in accordance with methods of AASHTO, ASTM, or the published Specifications of any other designated organization that are current on the date of advertisements for bids. Copies of all tests will be furnished to the Contractor’s representative at his request. Sampling and testing by the Department will be performed in accordance with the Sampling, Testing and Inspection Manual.

Section 106 — Control of Materials
For work performed under Section 400- Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction all materials shall be inspected and tested by the Contractor before incorporation into the work. The Contractor’s Quality Control Technician shall sample and test all quality control samples. The Contractor’s quality control tests may be used as acceptance tests at the discretion of the Engineer. Sampling and testing by the Contractor shall be performed according to the Sampling, Testing, and Inspection Manual. Copies of all tests performed by the Contractor shall be furnished to the Engineer and will become a part of the project records. The Department will be responsible only for determining the acceptability of the construction and materials incorporated therein. The Contractor shall be responsible for the quality of the construction and materials incorporated therein. The Department will monitor the Contractor’s Quality Assurance Acceptance Program to verify test accuracy.

# A. Testing and Acceptance Plans

# 1. A Lot

Work will be accepted on a Lot-to-Lot basis in accordance with the requirements specified in the Acceptance Plans specified in Section 400- Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction. Lot sizes will normally be specified. In the event, however, that operational conditions cause work to be interrupted, or only partially completed before the Lot size specified has been achieved, the Lot may be redefined by the Engineer as being either the amount of work accomplished within the day, or he may combine that work with the next Lot of work. A Lot is set forth in these specifications as a defined quantity of a specified material from a single source or a measured amount of specified construction assumed to be produced by the same process.

# 2. Acceptance Plans

The Acceptance Plan for a material, product, or an Item of construction, or completed work will be as specified hereinafter in Section 400 and Section 430 of these specifications. However, in addition to the following conditions, the Department reserves the right to test any additional material for work that appears defective and to require correction if necessary, prior to final acceptance of the project.

# 3. Resampling of Lots

It is the intent of these specifications that Lots of materials, products, Items of construction, or completed construction will meet specification requirements at the time of submission. Resampling of deficient Lots as a basis for check tests may be done by the Engineer at his option. Non-conforming Lots, which can be corrected by reworking, will not be re-sampled before such corrective action is taken. Sampling and testing of reworked areas shall be at the expense of the Contractor.

# 4. Acceptance or Rejection

Nonconforming Lots, materials, products, or Items of construction that are not adaptable to correction by reworking shall be removed and replaced, accepted without payment, or accepted at an adjusted price as stated in the specifications, or if not stated, as directed by the Engineer.

# 5. Following the application of the acceptance plan

the decision of the Engineer shall be final as to the acceptance, rejection, or acceptance at an adjusted price of the Lots unless the Contractor elects to remove and replace any deficient materials or work at his expense.

# 6. Adjusted Payment

# a. Single Deficiency

A single deficiency is defined as a deficiency involving one characteristic of a material within a Lot. In the case of single-characteristic deficiency, it shall be used directly to determine an adjusted Contract Price.

# b. Multiple Deficiency

A multiple deficiency is defined as deficiencies involving more than one characteristic of construction within a Lot. In the case of multiple deficiencies, the related adjusted percentage of contract price for each characteristic shall be determined and the greatest reduction in price shall be used to determine the Contract Unit Price to be paid. Should the total adjustment for any individual Lot be 50 percent or more, the Engineer will determine whether the deficient Lot should be removed and replaced or allowed to remain in place. No payment will be made for the original Lot or for its removal. Replacement of the Lot will be paid for in accordance with the provisions for the Item.

Section 106 — Control of Materials

# 106.06 Agricultural Lime and Fertilizer

The sale and distribution of Fertilizers and Agricultural Lime are governed by Acts of the Georgia General Assembly and Rules and Regulations of the State Department of Agriculture. Therefore, either of these materials may be sampled by authorized representatives of the State Commissioner of Agriculture. The Contractor may use these materials in The Work without sampling provided he notifies the Engineer 48 hours in advance of anticipated delivery to the job site. The Engineer reserves the right to request random sampling by a representative of the State Department of Agriculture.

The Contractor will not be expected to withhold application pending completion of tests but will not be relieved of the responsibility for the quality of the material furnished. In the event a sample fails to meet the requirements of the Georgia Law as evidenced by a report furnished by the Commissioner of Agriculture, the Engineer will deduct from monies due to the Contractor a sum equal to the penalty authorized by the above referenced Act.

# 106.07 Sample Holes

All holes dug or drilled for the purpose of taking samples or determining thickness any time before final acceptance of the project shall be repaired by the Contractor. The material replaced shall be compacted and finished to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Costs of this work shall be included in the appropriate Bid Items.

# 106.08 Storage of Materials

For purposes of this Specification, flammable materials are defined as those materials capable of being easily ignited and of burning quickly. Combustible materials are those materials capable of producing a usually rapid chemical process that creates heat and usually light.

Portions of the right-of-way, approved by the Engineer, may be used for material storage purposes and for the placing of the Contractor’s plant and equipment. Additional space required must be provided by the Contractor at no additional expense to the Department. Private property shall not be used for storage purposes without written permission of the owner or lessee, and if requested by the Engineer, copies of such written permission shall be furnished.

Materials shall be stored to assure the preservation of their quality and fitness for the work and shall be located so as to facilitate their prompt inspection. Stored materials, even though approved before storage, may again be inspected before their use in The Work.

All storage sites shall be restored to their original condition by the Contractor at no additional expense to the Department.

No flammable or combustible materials or harmful chemicals shall be stored within 200 ft (60 m) of a structure, to include but not limited to bridges nor within 200 ft. (60 m) of a roadway open to traffic. Such materials shall be stored in accordance with directions from the manufacturer and any applicable requirements of the Georgia Office of the Safety Fire Commissioner, Georgia Department of Community Affairs and current edition of the International Fire Code.

# Section 106 — Control of Materials

# 106.10 Local Material Sources

# A. Sources Shown on the Plans

Possible sources of local materials and/or disposal areas may be designated on the plans. The quality of materials in such deposits will be acceptable in general but the Department does not warrant either the quality or the quantity of materials shown on the plans. The Contractor shall determine the amount of equipment and work required to produce a material meeting the specifications. Pit mixing, selective excavation, and other such operations shall be expected, and the Contractor shall determine the extent of these activities. It shall be understood that it is not feasible to ascertain from samples the limits for an entire deposit and that variations in quality and quantity shall be considered as usual and are to be expected.

1. When easements to secure local materials and/or disposal areas are obtained by the Department, the plans will show the locations of the pits or areas, the amount of royalties and other costs and conditions of acquisition of the material. In all cases where the Department has secured easements for material pits and/or disposal areas, these easements will be assigned to the Contractor who shall make prompt payment to the owners of such pits for all royalty and crop damage costs for materials and/or areas, and who shall further fulfill all of the terms of the Easement. The Department does not warrant the title or any interest of the property owner in such Easements.
2. If the Contractor elects to use only a portion of the materials or area estimated to be available in any pit or disposal area, or only clears or partially clears the pit or area, and does not remove or deposit any material, he shall make a minimum payment to the property owner of at least 33-1/3 percent of the estimated value of the pit or areas as shown in the Easement, plus any crop damage costs called for by the Easement. The Contractor shall, before receiving final payment from the Department, submit to the Engineer a written statement signed by the owner stating that the owner has been paid in full and that all conditions agreed to have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the owner. The Department will not take any separate payment to the Contractor for these material acquisition costs except that reclamation of the pit or area, if required, will be paid for in accordance with Section 160. Should the Contractor fail to pay the property owner within 60 days after ceasing to use the pit or area, the Department may pay directly to the property owner any amounts due and deduct same from any funds due the Contractor. This provision does not affect the obligation of the Contractor under this Bond or the rights of the property owner or the Department under the Bond.

# B. Substitution of Sources of Materials

1. If, after the Contract is awarded, the Contractor wishes to substitute other sources for sources designated on the plans, he may do so provided the material to be substituted conforms to the specifications. The Contractor shall make all necessary arrangements with the property owners for removal of the material from substituted pits. Payment will be made for clearing and grubbing, stripping excavation, pit reclamation, and ditch excavation only to the extent required for pits shown in the Plans. This does not relieve the Contractor from planting a satisfactory cover crop of the type called for on the plans or required by the specifications on all scarred areas created by the removal of materials. In the event the Contractor substitutes a source for soil-cement, soil-bituminous, or other material to be stabilized, and the Engineer determines that the substitute source requires more stabilizing agent than the Plan pit, no payment will be made for the additional stabilizing agent required.
2. Substitution sources will not be allowed where the resulting scars will present an unsightly appearance from any State or Federal highway.

# C. Environmental Clearance of Local Material or Disposal Sites

Specific written environmental approval from the Engineer will be required for any local material or disposal sites not included in the Plans. No work shall be started at any potential local material or waste site not shown on the plans prior to receiving said environmental approval from the Engineer. Local material sites are defined as borrow pits, common borrow, base, embankment, sand clay base, topsoil base, soil cement base, granular embankment, asphalt sand, maintenance pits, or stockpiled borrow sources. Disposals sites, as defined in Standard Specification 201.3.05.E.3, may be defined as excess material, common fill, or inert waste.

The Contractor may obtain environmental approval on a site with one of two methods: 1) GDOT provided environmental surveys or 2) environmental surveys obtained by the Contractor at no cost to the Department. The Contractor must choose one method for review and approvals, which will apply to all sites required for a given project and submit an Environmental Review Notification indicating their chosen method.

1. If the Contractor chooses to obtain their own environmental surveys, they shall be conducted by a consultant(s) prequalified to work with the Department in the following area classes: 1.06(b) – History; 1.06(e) – Ecology; and 1.06(f) – Archaeology. Background research and field methods shall be conducted in accordance with the Office of Environmental Services Environmental Procedures Manual, with documentation in an Environmental Survey Results Memorandum (template available from the Office of Environmental Services).
2. If the Contractor requests that GDOT conduct required environmental surveys, an Environmental Survey Request shall be submitted for each site (template available from the Office of Environmental Services).

Upon receipt of an Environmental Survey Request, the Office of Environmental Services shall provide environmental approval or denial within thirty (30) business days. Upon receipt of an Environmental Survey Results Memorandum, the Office of Environmental Services shall provide environmental approval or denial within ten (10) business days. The Department will not accept requests for review of sites before a Notice to Proceed is issued. Incomplete Survey Requests, surveys that are not conducted by a GDOT prequalified consultant, or surveys that do not meet the required level of field effort or documentation, will be denied by GDOT OES and may require resubmittal.

The Engineer will inform the Contractor in writing as to the approval or denial of environmental clearance. Approvals may be provided upon condition that an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) be designated within or adjacent to the site prior to use. All ESA stipulations shall be adhered to in accordance with Standard Specification 107.23.F. If a site is denied, the Contractor may, at no expense to the Department, seek to obtain permits or pursue other remedies that might otherwise render the site(s) acceptable, if available. Any and all changes to proposed sites or their associated haul roads that are not included within the original Environmental Survey Request or Environmental Survey Results Memorandum, including expansion, utilization for purposes other than those indicated in the original submittal, etc. must be submitted for further environmental review and approval prior to use.

Sites included in the Plans have environmental clearance and shall be used only for the purpose(s) specified in the Plans or other contract documents. Should the Contractor wish to expand or utilize said sites for any purpose other than that provided for in the Plans or other contract documents, specific written environmental clearance as noted above shall be obtained.

# D. Control of Pollutants

Pollutants or potentially hazardous materials, such as fuels, lubricants, lead paint, chemicals or batteries, shall be transported, stored, and used in a manner to prevent leakage or spillage into the environment. The Contractor shall also be responsible for proper and legal disposal of all such materials.

3. Whenever temporary work is required in Saltwater Marsh Wetlands, all temporary structures and/or matting shall be removed in their entirety prior to Final Acceptance of the Project. Matted and compressed soils shall be backfilled to their original ground elevation with material meeting the requirements of Section 212 – Granular Embankment.
4. Whenever temporary work is required in Freshwater Wetlands, all temporary structures and/or matting (exclusive of soil matting to be retained in the final roadway section) shall be removed in their entirety prior to final acceptance of the project. Once the temporary materials have been removed, the area shall be covered by Excelsior or Straw blankets according to Section 713 of the Specifications. The grassing and ground preparation referenced in Subsection 713.3.03, Preparation, will not be applicable to this work.
5. The Engineer shall be notified so that a field inspection may be conducted to certify that the temporary materials were properly removed, and that the area was properly restored. The Contractor shall be responsible for any corrective action required to complete this work.
6. There will be no separate measurement or payment for this work. The cost associated with this work shall be included in the overall bid submitted.

# F. Environmentally Sensitive Areas

Some archaeological sites, historic sites, wetlands, streams, stream and pond buffers, open waters and protected animal and plant species habitat within the existing/required Right-of-Way and easement areas may be designated as ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAs (ESAs). These areas are shown on the applicable plan sheets and labeled “ESA” (e.g. ESA – Historical Boundary, ESA – Wetland Boundary). The Department may require that some ESAs or portions thereof be delineated with orange barrier fence. The Contractor shall install, maintain, and replace as necessary orange barrier fence at ESAs as delineated in the plan sheets.

The Contractor shall not enter, disturb, or perform any construction related activities, other than those shown on the approved plan sheets within areas designated as ESAs including ESAs or portions thereof not delineated with orange barrier fence. This includes but is not limited to the following construction activities: clearing and grubbing; borrowing; wasting; grading; filling; staging/stockpiling; vehicular use and parking; sediment basin placement; trailer placement; and equipment cleaning and storage. Also, all archaeological sites, historic sites, wetlands, streams, stream and pond buffers, open waters, and protected animal and plant species habitat that extend beyond the limits of existing/required Right-of- Way and easement areas shall be considered ESAs and the Contractor shall not perform any construction related activities (such as those listed above) within these areas or make agreements with property owners to occupy these areas for construction related activities (such as those listed above). The Contractor shall make all construction employees aware of the location(s) of each ESA and the requirement to not enter or otherwise disturb these areas.

If the Contractor is found to have entered an ESA, either within or outside the project area, for any purpose not specifically shown on the approved plan sheets, the Department may, at its discretion, issue a stop work order for all activities on the project except erosion control and traffic control until such time as all equipment and other items are removed and the ESA is restored to its original condition.

However, should damage to an ESA occur as a result of the Contractor’s action in violation of this section, and notwithstanding any subsequent correction by the Contractor, the Contractor shall be liable for any cost arising from such action, including but not limited to, the cost of repair, remediation of any fines, or mitigation fees assessed against the Department by another government entity.

Equipment used on any portion of the project shall be such that no injury to the roadway, adjacent property, or other highways will result from its use. When the methods and equipment to be used by the Contractor in accomplishing the construction are not prescribed in the Contract, the Contractor is free to use any methods or equipment that he demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Engineer will accomplish the work in conformity with the requirements of the Contract.

When the Contract specifies that the construction be performed by the use of certain methods and equipment, such methods and equipment shall be used unless others are authorized by the Engineer. If the Contractor desires to use a method or type of equipment other than those specified in the Contract, he may request authority from the Engineer to do so. The request shall be in writing and shall include a full description of the methods and equipment proposed to be used and an explanation of the reasons for desiring to make the change. If approval is given, it will be on the condition that the Contractor will be fully responsible for producing construction work in conformity with Contract requirements. If, after trial use of the substituted methods or equipment, the Engineer determines that the work produced does not meet Contract requirements, the Contractor shall discontinue the use of the substitute method or equipment and shall complete the remaining construction with the specified methods and equipment. The Contractor shall remove the deficient work and replace it with work of specified quality or take such other corrective action as the Engineer may direct. No change will be made in basis of payment for the construction items involved nor in Contract Time as a result of authorizing a change in methods or equipment under these provisions.

# 108.06 Temporary Suspension of Work

The Engineer has the authority to suspend the work wholly or in part, for as long as he may deem necessary, because of unsuitable weather, or other conditions considered unfavorable for continuing the work, or for as long as he may deem necessary by reason of failure of the Contractor to carry out orders given, or to comply with any provisions of the Contract. No additional compensation will be paid the Contractor because of suspension. If it becomes necessary to stop the work for an indefinite period, the Contractor shall store all materials in such a way that they will not impede the traveling public unnecessarily or become damaged in any way, and he shall take every precaution to prevent damage or deterioration of the work done; provide suitable drainage of the roadway, and erect temporary structures where necessary. The work shall be resumed when conditions are favorable or when corrective measures satisfactory to the Engineer have been applied; when, and as ordered by the Engineer in writing. The Contractor shall not stop the work without authority.

If the work is stopped by any temporary or permanent injunction, court restraining order, process or judgment of any kind, directed to either of the parties hereto, then such period or delay will not be charged against the Contract Time nor shall the Department be liable to the Contractor on account of such delay or termination of work.

# 108.07 Determination of Contract Time

The definition of Contract time and when Contract time officially begins is stated in Subsection 101.19. After the Contract has been signed by all parties, Contract time becomes the specified period of time, agreed upon by the Contractor, the Surety, and the Department, during which all Items and quantities of work set forth in the Proposal and included in the original Contract will be completed.

# A. Available Day Contracts

An available day is defined in Subsection 101.04. The Engineer will furnish the Contractor a written monthly statement showing the total number of available days charged through the preceding month. The Contractor will be allowed one week in which to file a written protest setting forth in what respect said statement is incorrect, otherwise the statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Contractor as correct.

# B. Calendar Day Contracts

When the Contract time is on a calendar day basis it shall consist of the number of calendar days stated in the Contract counting from the date Contract time starts as defined in Subsection 108.02, including all Sundays, holidays, and non-work days.



---

Section 108 — Prosecution and Progress

# C. Completion Day Contracts

When the Contract completion time is a fixed date, it shall be the date on which all work on the project shall be completed.

# D. Settlement Periods

Settlement periods shall be computed in calendar days unless otherwise stated in the contract documents.

# E. Extension of Contract Time

If satisfactory fulfillment of the Contract requires performance of work in greater quantities than those set forth in the Proposal, the Contract time allowed for performance shall be extended on a basis commensurate with the amount and difficulty of the added work as determined by the Engineer, whose decision shall be final and conclusive.

If the estimated time for the consolidation of embankments at bridge ends is extended, the Contract time will be extended as provided in Subsection 208.3.05.B.3.

If the normal progress of the work is delayed for reasons beyond his control, the Contractor shall, within 15 days after the start of such delay, file a written request to the Engineer for an extension of time setting forth therein the reasons and providing complete documentation for the delay which he believes will justify the granting of his request. The Contractor’s plea that insufficient time was specified is not a valid reason for extension of time. If the Engineer finds that the work was delayed because of conditions beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor, he may extend the time for completion in such amount as the conditions justify.

Any authorized extension of the Contract Time will be in full force and effect the same as though it was the original Contract time.

# F. Suspension of Time Charges

If the Engineer suspends the work by reason of failure of the Contractor to carry out written orders given, or to comply with any provision of the Contract, time charges will continue through the period of such suspension.

If the Contractor is declared in default, time charges will continue.

Except on completion date Contracts, time charges will not be made against the Contract when the only remaining controlling items of work are shut down by the Engineer because of seasonal limitations or temperature controls.

# G. When Time Charges Cease

Time charges will cease when all work on Contract Items have been completed to the satisfaction of the Engineer. The only exceptions to this requirement are that a satisfactory growth of vegetative cover, application(s) of nitrogen and Final Documentation will not be required when time charges are stopped. Final documentation includes final DBE Report, Reflectivity testing Report, and NPDES Notice of Termination. Filling of all washes and repairs to planted areas have to be accomplished as a prerequisite of vegetative cover and nitrogen condition.

Maintenance of planted areas in order to produce a satisfactory growth after time charges have stopped will be performed without assessment of liquidated damages provided this work is diligently prosecuted. If, during this waiting period, maintenance of any part of the project is inadequate, the Engineer may resume time charges 10 days after written notification to the Contractor and will continue time charges until the unsatisfactory conditions are corrected. If final documentation associated with the project is not received within fifty (50) days of the final inspection, the Engineer may resume time charges 10 days after written notification to the Contractor and will continue time charges until necessary documentation is received.

Section 108 — Prosecution and Progress

# 108.08 Failure or Delay in Completing Work on Time

Time is an essential element of the Contract, and any delay in the prosecution of the work may inconvenience the public, obstruct traffic, or interfere with business. In addition to the aforementioned inconveniences, any delay in completion of the work will always increase the cost of engineering. For this reason, it is important that the work be pressed vigorously to completion. Should the Contractor or, in case of default, the Surety fail to complete the work within the time stipulated in the Contract or within such extra time that may be allowed, charges shall be assessed against any money due or that may become due the Contractor in accordance with the following schedule:

| Original Contract Amount |             | Schedule of Deductions for Each Day of Overrun in Contract Time |               |               |                                 |   |

| $30,000,000              | $40,000,000 | $8,328                                                          | $5,949        |               |                                 |   |
| $40,000,000              | $50,000,000 | $10,707                                                         | $7,648        |               |                                 |   |
| $50,000,000              | $11,897     |                                                                 | $8,498        |               |                                 |   |

When the Contract time is on either the calendar day or completion date basis, the schedule for calendar days shall be used. When the Contract time is based on an available day basis, the schedule for available days shall be used. For each calendar day or available day, as specified, that any work shall remain uncompleted after the contract time specified for the completion of the work required by the Contract, the sum specified in the Contract will be deducted from any money due the Contractor, not as a penalty, but as liquidated damages; provided however, that due account shall be taken of any adjustment of the contract time for completion of the work granted under the provisions of Subsection 108.07.E.

The Department may waive such portions of the liquidated damages as may accrue after the work is in condition for safe and convenient use by the traveling public.

# Section 108 — Prosecution and Progress

# A. Liquidated Damages

The amount of such charges is hereby agreed upon as fixed liquidated damages due the Department after the
expiration of the time for completion specified in the Contract. The Contractor and his Surety shall be liable for
liquidated damages in excess of the amount due the Contractor on the final payment.

These fixed liquidated damages are not established as a penalty but are calculated and agreed upon in advance
by the Department and the Contractor due the uncertainty and impossibility of making a determination as to the
actual and consequential damages which are incurred by the Department, the State, and the general public as a
result of the failure on the part of the Contractor to complete the work on time.

1. Deduction from Partial Payments: Liquidated damages, as they accrue, will be deducted from periodic
partial payments.
2. Deduction from Final Payment: The full amount of liquidated damages will be deducted from final payment
to the Contractor and/or its Surety.
3. No Liquidated Damages Charged for Delay by the Department: In case of default of the Contract and the
subsequent completion of the work by the Department as hereinafter provided, the Contractor and his Surety
shall be liable for the liquidated damages under the Contract, but no liquidated damages shall be chargeable
for any delay in the final completion of the work by the Department due to any unreasonable action,
negligence, omission, or delay of the Department. In any suit for the collection of or involving the assessment
of liquidated damages, the reasonableness of the amount shall be presumed. The liquidated damages
referred to herein are intended to be and are cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy now or
hereafter enforceable at law, in equity, by statute, or under the Contract.

# B. No Waiver of Department’s Rights

Permitting the Contractor to continue and finish The Work or any part of it after the expiration of the time allowed
for completion or after any extension of time, shall not operate as a waiver of the rights of the Department under
the Contract.

# 108.09 Default of Contract

If the Contractor fails to begin the work within the time specified, or fails to perform the work with sufficient workers,
equipment, or materials to ensure its prompt completion, or performs the work unsuitably, or neglects or refuses to
remove materials or perform anew such work as shall be rejected as defective and unsuitable, or discontinues the
prosecution of the work, or from any other cause whatsoever does not carry on the work in an acceptable manner, or
becomes insolvent or is adjudicated a bankrupt, or commits any act of bankruptcy or insolvency, or allows any final
judgement to stand against him unsatisfied for a period of 10 days, or makes an assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or fails to comply with the contract requirements regarding wage payments or EEO requirements, or fails to
sign the standard release form as stipulated in Subsection 109.08 Final Payment, the Engineer may give notice in
writing by registered or certified mail to the Contractor and the Surety, stating the nature of the deficiencies and
directing that The Work including its progress be remedied and made satisfactory.

If, within 10 days after such notice, the Contractor or its Surety does not proceed in satisfactory way to remedy the
faults specified in said notice, the Engineer will notify the Contractor and its Surety by registered or certified mail that
the Contractor is in default and, by the same message, direct the Surety to take over the work including all of the
obligations pertaining to the Contract. If the Surety takes over the work in a satisfactory way within 10 days after such
notice of default, the Department will thenceforth pay to the Surety the amounts due and to become due under the
Contract, less all deductions provided herein including liquidated damages. The Department shall not be liable for any
sums not due under the Contract and shall not be made a party to any dispute between the Contractor and the Surety.

If the Contractor is declared in default and the work and other Contract obligations are taken over by the Surety as
required by its Bond, and when all parts of the work have been completed and found to be satisfactory by the
Engineer, as provided for in Subsection 105.16 Final Inspection and Acceptance, the said Surety is hereby constituted
the attorney in fact of the Contractor for the purpose of executing such final releases as may be required by the
Department or to do any other act or thing, including the execution of any documents, necessary to the completion of
the Contract and a final settlement of same, including but not limited to those documents required by the provisions
regarding final payment and release as set forth in Subsection 109.08.



---


# Section 108 — Prosecution and Progress

For all purposes, as herein set out and defined, including the execution of documents necessary to the final completion and settlement of the Contract, the Surety, under such circumstances, is hereby authorized and directed by the Contractor to perform such acts and execute such documents as fully and completely as though the same were performed or executed by such contractor, and to be lawfully binding upon such Contractor as though such acts had been performed or such documents executed by him in person.

If the Surety does not take over The Work in a satisfactory way within 10 days after the notice of default, or does not proceed to finish The Work according to the Contract, the Department shall have full power and authority, without impairing the obligation of the Contract or the Contract Bond, to take over the completion of The Work; to appropriate or use any or all material and equipment on the ground that may be suitable, to enter into agreements with others for the completion of the Contract according to the terms and provisions thereof; or to use such other methods as may be required for the completion of the Contract. In so assuming the obligations of the Contractor, the Department does so as the agent of the Contractor. Assumption of these duties and obligations by the Department will not act as a release of the Contractor or its Surety from any of the provisions of this Contract. The Contractor and its Surety shall be liable for all costs incurred by the Department in completing the work and also for all liquidated damages in conformity with the terms of the Contract. If the sum of such liquidated damages and the expense so incurred by the Department is less than the sum which would have been payable under this Contract if it had been completed by the Contractor or its Surety, the Contractor, or its Surety, shall be entitled to receive the difference; and if the sum of such expense and such liquidated damages exceeds the sum that would have been payable under the Contract, the Contractor and its Surety shall be liable and shall pay to the Department the amount of such excess. Notice to the Contractor shall be deemed to have been served when delivered to the person in charge of any office used by the Contractor, its representative at or near the work or by registered or certified mail addressed to the Contractor at the last known place of business.

Time charges shall continue through a period of a default in compliance with the provisions of Subsection 108.07.F.

# 108.10 Termination of Contractor’s Responsibility

Except as specified in the Contract Bond and in Subsection 107.20, the Contractor’s responsibility for the work shall terminate upon final acceptance of the work by the Department.

# Section 109—Measurement and Payment

# 109.01 Measurement and Quantities

The method of measurement and computations to be used in determination of quantities of material furnished and of work performed under the Contract will be those methods generally recognized as conforming to good engineering practice.

Unless otherwise specified, longitudinal measurements for area computations will be made along the surface, and no deductions will be made for individual fixtures having an area of 9 ft.² (1 m²) or less. Unless otherwise specified, transverse measurements for area computations will be the neat dimensions shown on the plans or ordered in writing by the Engineer.

Where payment is to be made by the square yard (square meter) for a specified thickness, the length will be measured on the surface along the centerline and the pay width shall be that width specified on the plans for the Final surface of the completed section. Intermediate courses shall be placed at a width sufficient to support successive courses with no detriment to the stability of the successive courses. The width of material required beyond the pay width will not be eligible for payment and shall be considered incidental to the work.

Structures will be measured according to neat lines shown on the Plans or as altered to fit field conditions.

All items which are measured by the linear foot (linear meter), such as pipe culverts, guard rail, underdrains, etc., will be measured parallel to the base or foundation upon which such structures are placed, unless otherwise shown on the plans.

In computing volumes of excavation, the average end area method or other acceptable methods will be used.

The term “gage,” when used in connection with the measurement of steel plates, will mean the U.S. Standard Gage. When the term “gage” refers to the measurement of electrical wire it will mean the wire gage specified in the National Electrical Code.

The term “ton” will mean the short ton consisting of 2,000 pounds avoirdupois. The term “megagram” will mean one metric ton, equivalent to 1,000 kg. Any commodity paid for by weight shall be weighed on scales that have been approved as specified below and which are furnished at the expense of the Contractor or Supplier. Weighing and measuring systems including remote controls shall be subject to type-approval by the Department of Transportation.

The manufacture, installation, performance, and operation of such devices located in Georgia shall conform to, and be governed by, the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 10-2-5 of the Georgia Weights and Measures Act, the Georgia Weights and Measures Regulations, as amended and adopted, the current edition of the National Bureau of Standards Handbook 44, and these specifications. Weighing and measuring systems located outside Georgia which are utilized for weighing materials to be used in Department work shall be manufactured, installed, approved, and operated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations for the state in which the scales are located.

All weighing, measuring, and metering devices used to measure quantities for payment shall be suitable for the purpose intended and will be considered to be commercial devices. Commodity scales located in Georgia shall be certified before use for accuracy, condition, etc., by the Weights and Measures Division of the Georgia Department of Agriculture, or its authorized representative. Scales located outside Georgia shall be certified in accordance with applicable laws and regulations for the state in which the scales are located. This certification shall have been made within a period of not more than one year prior to date of use for weighing commodity.

All equipment and all mechanisms and devices attached thereto or used in connection therewith shall be constructed, assembled, and installed for use so that they do not facilitate the perpetration of fraud. Any scale component or mechanism, which if manipulated would alter true scale values (including manual zero setting mechanisms) shall not be accessible to the scale operator. Such components and mechanisms that would otherwise be accessible to the scale operator shall be enclosed. Provisions shall be made for security seals where appropriate on equipment and accessories. A security seal shall be affixed to any adjustment mechanism designed to be sealed. Scale or accessory devices shall not be used if security seals have been broken or removed.

Any certified scale or scale component which has been repaired, dismantled, or moved to another location shall again be tested and certified before it is eligible for weighing.



---


# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

Whenever materials that are paid for based on weight are from a source within the State, the scales shall be operated by and the weights attested to by signature and seal of a duly authorized Certified Public Weigher in accordance with Standard Operating Procedure 15 and the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 10-2-5 of the Georgia Weights and Measures Act as amended and adopted. When such materials originate from another state that has a certified or licensed weigher program, the scales shall be operated by a weigher who is certified by that state in accordance with applicable laws, and weight ticket recordation shall be in accordance with Standard Operating Procedure 15.

When materials are paid for based on weight and originate from another state which has no program for certifying or licensing weighers, the materials shall be weighed on scales located in the State of Georgia by a Certified Public Weigher in accordance with Standard Operating Procedure 15 and the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 10-2-5 of the Georgia Weights and Measures Act as amended and adopted.

No scale shall be used to measure weights greater than the scale manufacturer’s rated capacity. A digital recorder shall be installed as part of any commodity scale. The recorder shall produce a printed digital record on a ticket with the gross, tare, and net weights of the delivery trucks, along with the date and time printed for each ticket. Provisions shall be made so that the scales or recorders may not be manually manipulated during the printing process. The system shall be so interlocked as to allow printing only when the scale has come to rest. Either the gross or net weight shall be a direct scale reading. Printing and recording systems that are capable of accepting keyboard entries shall clearly and automatically differentiate a direct scale weight value from any other weight values printed on the load ticket.

All scales used to determine pay quantities shall be provided to attain a zero-balance indication with no load on the load receiving element by the use of semi-automatic zero (push-button zero) or automatic zero maintenance. Vehicle scales shall have a platform of sufficient size to accommodate the entire length of any vehicle weighed and shall have sufficient capacity to weigh the largest load. Adequate drainage shall be provided to prevent saturation of the ground under the scale foundation.

The Engineer, at his discretion, may require the platform scales to be checked for accuracy. For this purpose, the Contractor shall load a truck with material of his choosing, weigh the loaded truck on his scales, and then weigh it on another set of certified vehicle scales. When the difference exceeds 0.4 percent of load, the scales shall be corrected and certified by a registered scale serviceman registered in the appropriate class as outlined in the Georgia Weights and Measures Regulations or in accordance with applicable requirements of the state in which the scales are located. A test report shall be submitted to the appropriate representative of the Department of Agriculture.

Materials to be measured by volume in the hauling vehicle shall be hauled in approved vehicles and measured therein at the point of delivery. Vehicles for this purpose may be of any size or type acceptable to the Engineer, provided that the body is of such shape that the actual contents may be readily and accurately determined. All vehicles shall be loaded to their water level capacity as determined by the Engineer, provided that the body is of such shape that the actual contents may be readily and accurately determined.

Cement and lime will be measured by the ton (megagram). Whenever cement or lime is delivered to the project in tank trucks, a certified weight shall be made at the shipping point by an authorized Certified Public Weigher who is not an employee of the Department. Whenever cement and lime are from a source within the State, the scales shall be operated by the weights attested to by signature and seal of a duly authorized Certified Public Weigher in accordance with Standard Operating Procedure 15 and the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 10-2-5 of the Georgia Weights and Measures Act as amended and adopted. When such materials originate from another state that has a certified or licensed weigher program, the scales shall be operated by a weigher who is certified by that state in accordance with applicable laws, and the weight ticket recordation shall be in accordance with Standard Operating Procedure 15. When cement and lime originate from another state that has no program for certifying or licensing weighers, the materials shall be weighed on scales located in the State of Georgia by a Certified Public Weigher in accordance with Standard Operating Procedure 15 and the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 10-2-5 of the Georgia Weights and Measures Act as amended and adopted.

The shipping invoice shall contain the certified weights and the signature and seal of the Certified Public Weigher. A security seal shall also be affixed to the discharge pipe cap on the tank truck before leaving the shipping point. The number on the security seal shall also be recorded on the shipping invoice. The shipping invoice for quicklime shall also contain a certified lime purity percentage. Unsealed tank trucks will require reweighing by a Certified Public Weigher.

# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

Timber will be measured by the thousand feet board measure (MFBM) (cubic meter) actually incorporated in the structure. Measurements will be based on nominal widths and thickness and the actual length in place. No additional measurement will be made for splices except as noted for overlaps as shown on the plans.

The term “Lump Sum” when used as an item of payment will mean complete payment for the work described in the Contract.

When a complete structure or structural unit (in effect, “Lump Sum” work) is specified as the unit of the measurement, the unit will be construed to include all necessary fittings and accessories.

Rental of equipment will be measured as defined in Subsection 109.05.B.4.

When standard manufactured items are specified as fence, wire, plates, rolled shapes, pipe conduits, etc., and these items are identified by gage, unit weight, section dimensions, etc., such identification will be considered to be nominal weights or dimensions. Unless more stringently controlled by tolerance in cited Specifications, manufacturing tolerances established by the industries involved will be accepted.

# 109.02 Measurement of Bituminous Materials

# By Weighing the Material

The Department prefers this method whenever it is practicable. This method will be considered acceptable under the following conditions:

1. Weighed on Project: If the weights of the bituminous materials delivered by tank trucks are to be determined on the Project, weights shall be determined on scales that have been previously checked by the Department with standard weights for accuracy. The scale platform shall be large enough to accommodate the entire vehicle at one time. Under no conditions will truck scales be used to measure weights greater than their rated capacity. All weights not determined in the presence of an authorized representative of the Department shall be made by a Certified Public Weigher who is not an employee of the Department of Transportation and who is in good standing with the Georgia Department of Agriculture. The weight tickets shall carry both the signature and seal of the Certified Public Weigher.
2. Weighed at Shipping Point: A certified weight made at the shipping point by an authorized Certified Public Weigher who is not an employee of the Department of Transportation and who is registered with the Georgia Department of Agriculture, will be acceptable provided all openings in the tank have been sealed by the producer and when, upon inspection on the Project, there is no evidence of any leakage. The shipping ticket in this case must carry the signature and seal of the Certified Public Weigher. If the tank is not completely emptied the amount of material remaining in the tank truck will be measured by either weight or volume and the amount so determined, as verified by the Engineer, will be deducted from the certified weight.
3. By Extraction Analysis: The weight of bituminous material used will be determined by extraction tests made by the field laboratory. The average asphalt content for each Lot will be used to compute the weight of the Asphalt Cement to be paid for in accordance with the following formula:

English:

P = % AC x T

Where:

- P = Pay Tons of Asphalt Cement
- % AC = Lot average of % Asphalt Cement by weight of total mix as determined by extraction
- T = Actual accepted tons of mixture as weighed

Metric:

P = % AC x T

Where:

- P = Pay megagrams of Asphalt Cement
- % AC = Lot average of % Asphalt Cement by weight of total mix as determined by extraction
- T = Actual accepted megagrams of mixture as weighed

By Digital Recording Device: The amount of bituminous material as shown on the printed tickets will be the Pay Quantity.

The volume will be measured and corrected for the difference between actual temperature and 60 °F (15 °C). Containers shall be level when measured, and one of the following methods shall be used, whichever is best suited to the circumstances:

1. Tank Car Measurement: If the material is shipped to the Project in railroad tank cars, the Contractor shall furnish the Engineer a certified chart showing the dimensions and volume for each inch (25 mm) of depth for each tank. The Engineer will make outage and temperature measurements before unloading is begun and after it is finished. The measurements will be taken when the bituminous material is at a uniform temperature and free from air bubbles. The Contractor shall not remove any bituminous material from any tank until necessary measurements have been made nor shall he release the car until final outage has been measured. The total number of gallons (liters) allowed for any tank car shall not be more than the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission rating for that car, converted to gallons at 60 °F (15 °C).
2. Truck Measurement: If bituminous materials are delivered to the Project in tank trucks, distributor tanks, or drums, the Contractor shall not remove any bituminous material from the transporting vehicle or container until necessary measurements have been made, nor shall the transporting vehicle or container be released until final outage has been measured. If weighing is not convenient, the Contractor shall furnish the Engineer with a certified chart showing the dimensions and volume of each container together with a gauge or calibrated measuring rod which will permit the volume of the material to be determined by vertical measurement.
3. Metering: The volume may be determined by metering, in which case the metering device used and the method of using it shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer.
4. Time of Deliveries: The arrival and departure of vehicles delivering bituminous materials to the Project site shall be so scheduled that the Engineer is afforded proper time for the measurements of delivered volume and final outage. The Engineer will make the necessary measurements only during the Contractor’s normal daily working hours.

# Production for Multiple Projects

When a Contractor is producing Asphaltic Concrete from one plant, which is being placed on two or more jobs, public or private, the amount of bituminous material used may be determined by extraction tests in accordance with Subsection 109.02.A.3 or digital recording device in accordance with Subsection 109.02.A.4.

# Tack Coat

When the same storage facility is utilized for Bituminous Materials to be used in Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete, Bituminous Tack Coat, and/or Surface Treatment, the quantity used for Tack Coat shall be converted to tons (megagrams) and deducted from the quantities for the Bituminous Material used in the Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete and Surface Treatment.

# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

# Corrections

When the volume and temperature have been determined as defined above, the volume will be corrected by the use of the following formula:

VEnglish = V1      Vmetric = V1

K (t-60) + 1      K (t-15) + 1

Where:

- V = Volume of bituminous material at 60 °F (15 °C)
- V1 = Volume of hot bituminous material
- t = Temperature of hot bituminous material in degrees Fahrenheit (Celsius)
- K = Coefficient of Expansion of bituminous material (correction factor)

The correction factors K for various materials are given below:

- 0.00035 (0.00063) per °F (°C) for petroleum oils having a specific gravity of 60 °F/60 °F (15 °C/15 °C) above 0.966
- 0.00040 (0.00072) per °F (°C) for petroleum oils having a specific gravity of 60 °F/60 °F (15 °C/15 °C) between 0.850-0.966
- 0.00030 (0.00054) per °F (°C) for Tar
- 0.00025 (0.00045) per °F (°C) for Emulsified Asphalt
- 0.00040 (0.00072) per °F (°C) for Creosote Oil

# 109.03 Scope of Payment

The Contractor shall receive and accept the compensation provided for in the Contract as full payment for furnishing all materials, labor, tools, equipment, superintendence and incidentals, and for performing all work contemplated and embraced under the Contract in a complete and acceptable manner, for any infringement of patent, trademark or copyright, for all loss or damage arising from the nature of the work, or from the action of the elements, for all expenses incurred by or in consequence of the suspension or discontinuance of the work, or from any unforeseen difficulties which may be encountered during the prosecution of the work and for all risks of every description connected with the prosecution of the work until its final acceptance by the Engineer, except as provided in Subsection 107.16.

The payment of any partial estimate prior to final acceptance of the project as provided in Subsection 105.16 shall in no way affect the obligation of the Contractor to repair or renew any defective parts of the construction or to be responsible for all damages due to such defects.

# 109.04 Payment and Compensation for Altered Quantities

When alteration in plans or quantities of work not requiring Supplemental Agreements as herein before provided for are ordered and performed, the Contractor shall accept payment in full at the Contract Unit Bid Prices for the actual quantities of work done, and no allowance will be made for increased expense, loss of expected reimbursement, or loss of anticipated profits suffered or claimed by the Contractor, resulting either directly from such alterations, or indirectly from unbalanced allocation among the Contract Items of overhead expense on the part of the Bidder and subsequent loss of expected reimbursement therefore, or from any other cause.

Compensation for alterations in plans or quantities of work requiring Supplemental Agreements shall be as stipulated in such agreement, except that when the Contractor proceeds with The Work without change of price being agreed upon, he shall be paid for such increased or decreased quantities at the Contract Unit Prices Bid in the Proposal for the Items of the work.

# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

# 109.05 Extra Work

Extra work, as defined in Subsection 101.27, when ordered in accordance with Subsection 104.04, will be authorized in writing by the Engineer. The authorization will be in the form of a Supplemental Agreement or a Force Account.

# A. Supplemental Agreement

In the case of a Supplemental Agreement, the work to be done will be stipulated and agreed upon by both parties prior to any extra work being performed. Payment based on Supplemental Agreements shall constitute full payment and settlement of all additional costs and expenses including delay and impact damages caused by, arising from or associated with the work performed.

# B. Force Account

When no agreement is reached for extra work to be done at lump sum or unit prices, such work may be authorized by the Department to be done on a Force Account basis. A Force Account estimate that identifies all anticipated costs shall be prepared by the Contractor on forms provided by the Engineer. Work shall not begin until the Force Account is approved. Payment for Force Account work will be in accordance with the following:

1. Labor: For all labor, equipment operators and supervisors, excluding superintendents, in direct charge of the specific operations, the Contractor shall receive the rate of wage agreed upon in writing before beginning work for each and every hour that said labor, equipment operators and supervisors are actually engaged in such work. The Contractor shall receive the actual costs paid to, or in behalf of, workers by reason of subsistence and travel allowances, health and welfare benefits, pension fund benefits, or other benefits, when such amounts are required by collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract generally applicable to the classes of labor employed on the work. An amount equal to 15% of the sum of the above items will also be paid the Contractor.
2. Bond, Insurance, and Tax: For property damage, liability, and worker's compensation insurance premiums, unemployment insurance contributions, and Social Security taxes on the Force Account work, the Contractor shall receive the actual cost, to which cost no percentage will be added. The Contractor shall furnish satisfactory evidence of the rate or rates paid for such bond, insurance, and tax.
3. Materials: For materials accepted by the Engineer and used, the Contractor shall receive the actual cost of such material incorporated into the work, including Contractor paid transportation charges (exclusive of machinery rentals as hereinafter set forth), to which cost 10% will be added.
4.

Standby rates shall apply when equipment is not in operation and is directed by the Engineer to standby for later use. In general, Standby rates shall apply when equipment is not in use but will be needed again to complete the work and the cost of moving the equipment will exceed the accumulated standby cost. Payment for standby time will not be made on any day the equipment operates for 8 or more hours. For equipment accumulating less than 8 hours operating time on any normal workday, standby payment will be limited to only that number of hours which, when added to the operating time for that day equals 8 hours. Standby payment will not be made on days that are not normally considered workdays.

The Department will not approve any rates in excess of the rates as outlined above unless such excess rates are supported by an acceptable breakdown of cost.

Payable time periods will not include:

- Time elapsed while equipment is broken down
- Time spent in repairing equipment, or
- Time elapsed after the Engineer has advised the Contractor the equipment is no longer needed

If a piece of equipment is needed which is not included in the above Blue Book rental rates, reasonable rates shall be agreed upon in writing before the equipment is used. All equipment charges by persons or firms other than the Contractor shall be supported by invoices.

Transportation charges for each piece of equipment to and from the site of the work will be paid provided:

- The equipment is obtained from the nearest approved source
- The return charges do not exceed the delivery charges
- Haul rates do not exceed the established rates of licensed haulers, and
- Such charges are restricted to those units of equipment not already available and not on or near the project

The Contractor's representative and the Engineer shall compare records and agree on the cost of work done as ordered on a Force Account basis at the end of each day on forms provided by the Department.

# 7. Subcontract Force Account Work:

For work performed by an approved Subcontractor or Second-tier Subcontractor, all provisions of this Section (109.05) that apply to the Prime Contractor in respect to labor, materials and equipment shall govern. The prime Contractor shall coordinate the work of his Subcontractor. The prime Contractor will be allowed an amount to cover administrative cost equal to 5% of the Subcontractor's amount earned but not to exceed $5,000.00 per Subcontractor. Markup for Second-tier Subcontract work will not be allowed.

Should it become necessary for the Contractor or Subcontractor to hire a firm to perform a specialized type of work or service which the prime Contractor or Subcontractor is not qualified to perform, payment will be made at reasonable invoice cost. To each invoice cost a markup to cover administrative cost equal to 5% of the total invoice but not to exceed $5,000.00 will be allowed the Contractor or Subcontractor but not both.

# 8. Statements:

No payment will be made for work performed on a Force Account basis until the Contractor has furnished the Engineer with duplicate itemized statements of the cost of such Force Account work detailed as follows:

---

# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

Statements shall be accompanied and supported by invoices for all materials used and transportation charges. However, if materials used on the Force Account work are not purchased specifically for such work but are taken from the Contractor's stock, then, in lieu of the invoices, the Contractor shall furnish an affidavit certifying that such materials were taken from his stock, that the quantity claimed was actually used, and that the price and transportation claimed represent the actual cost to the Contractor. Payment based on Force Account records shall constitute full payment and settlement of all additional costs and expenses including delay and impact damages caused by, arising from or associated with the work performed.

# 109.06 Eliminated Items

Should any Items contained in the Proposal be found unnecessary for the proper completion of the work, the Engineer may, upon written order to the Contractor, eliminate such Items from the Contract, and such action shall in no way invalidate the Contract. When a Contractor is notified of the elimination of Items, he will be reimbursed for actual work done and all costs incurred, including mobilization of materials prior to said notifications.

# 109.07 Partial Payments

# A. General

At the end of each calendar month, the total value of Items complete in place will be estimated by the Engineer and certified for payment. Such estimate is approximate only and may not necessarily be based on detailed measurements. Value will be computed on the basis of Contract Item Unit Prices or on percentage of completion of lump sum Items. When so requested by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer, Gross Earnings of $500,000.00 or more for work completed within the first 15 days of any month will be certified for payment on a semi-monthly basis subject to the conditions and provisions of Subsection 109.07.A, Subsection 109.07.B.6, Subsection 109.07.C, Subsection 109.07.D, Subsection 109.07.E, and Subsection 109.07.F.

# B. Materials Allowance

Payments will be made on delivered costs, or percentage of bid price if otherwise noted, with copies of paid invoices provided to the Department for the materials listed below which are to be incorporated into the Project provided the materials:

- Conform to all specification requirements.
- Are stored on the project Right-of-Way or, upon written request by the Contractor and written approval of the Engineer, they may be stored off the Right-of-Way, but local to the project, provided such storage is necessary due to lack of storage area on the Right-of-Way, need for security, or need for protection from weather.

As a further exception to on-project storage, upon written request by the Contractor, the Engineer may approve off-the-project storage items uniquely fabricated or precast for a specific Project, such as structural steel and precast concrete, which will be properly marked with the Project number and stored at the fabrication or precast facility. The Engineer may approve out-of-state storage for structural steel and prestressed concrete beams uniquely fabricated for a specific Project stored at the fabrication facility.

1. Paid invoices should accompany the materials allowance request, but in no case be submitted to the project Engineer later than 30 calendar days following the date of the progress payment report on which the materials allowance was paid. In case such paid invoices are not furnished within the established time, the materials allowance payment will be removed from the next progress statement and no further materials allowance will be made for that item on that project.

# Measurement and Payment

2. Materials allowances will be paid for those items which are not readily available, and which can be easily identified and secured for a specific project and for which lengthy stockpiling periods would not be detrimental. Some exclusions are as follows:

- a. No payments will be made on living or perishable plant materials until planted.
- b. No payments will be made on Portland Cement, Liquid Asphalt, or grassing materials.
- c. No payment will be made for aggregate stockpiled in a quarry. Payment for stockpiled aggregate will be made only if the aggregate is stockpiled on or in the immediate vicinity of the project and is held for the exclusive use on that project. The aggregate must be properly secured. If the aggregate stockpiled is to be paid for per-ton (megagram) it must be reweighed on approved scales at the time it is incorporated into the project.
- d. No payments will be made on minor material items, hardware, etc.

3. No materials allowance will be made for materials when it is anticipated that those materials will be incorporated into The Work within 30 calendar days.

4. No materials allowance will be made for a material when the requested allowance for such material is less than $25,000.

5. Where a storage area is used for more than one project, material for each project shall be segregated from material for other projects, identified, and secured. Adequate access for auditing shall be provided. All units shall be stored in a manner so that they are clearly visible for counting and/or inspection of the individual units.

6. Materials allowance for prestressed concrete and structural steel bridge members may be processed for uncast or unfabricated members upon the Engineer’s receipt of a true copy of the binding order for the members required by the plan. Such copy shall be sealed and notarized by both the contractor placing the order and the supplier therein identified to cast or fabricate said members. All orders shall demonstrate conformance to the approved plans and specifications regarding beam type, size, length, material quantities and shall not exceed the approved plan quantity. The materials allowance applied to uncast prestressed concrete members will be made in amount equal to 40 percent of the invoice for the respective member(s) to the contractor. The materials allowance applied to unfabricated structural steel bridge members will be made in amount equal to 55 percent of the invoice for the respective member(s) to the contractor. An additional material allowance may be requested separately upon completion of the casting or fabricating for a maximum 90 percent of the invoice for the member(s) provided there is adherence to all other provisions of this specification.

7. The Commissioner may, at his discretion, grant waiver to the requirements of this Section when, in his opinion, such waiver would be in the public interest. Subsequently, in the event the material is not on-hand and in the quantities for which the materials allowance was granted, the materials allowance payment will be removed from the next progress statement and no further materials allowance will be made for those items on that project. If sufficient earnings are not available on the next progress statement, the Contractor agrees to allow the Department to recover the monies from any other Contract he may have with the Department, or to otherwise reimburse the Department. Excluding item 6 above, payments for materials on hand shall not exceed the invoice price or 75 percent of the bid prices for the pay items into which the materials are to be incorporated, whichever is less.

# C. Minimum Payment

No partial payment will be made unless the amount of payment is at least $1000.00.

# D. Liquidated Damages

Accrued liquidated damages will be deducted in accordance with Subsection 108.08.

# E. Other Deductions

In addition to the deductions provided for above, the Department has the right to withhold any payments due the Contractor for items unpaid by the Contractor for which the Department is directly responsible, including, but not limited to, royalties (see Section 106).

# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

hereby stipulated, he is forever barred and stopped from any recovery or claim whatsoever under the terms of this Contract.

Should the Contractor fail to execute the Standard Release Form or file suit within 45 days after delivery thereof, then the Surety on the Contractor’s Bond is hereby constituted the attorney-in-fact of the Contractor for the purpose of executing such final releases as may be required by the Department, including but not limited to the Standard Release Form, and for the purpose of receiving the Final Payment under this Contract.

The Department reserves the right as defined in Subsection 107.20, should an error be discovered in any estimates, to claim and recover from the Contractor or its Surety, or both, such sums as may be sufficient to correct any error of overpayment. Such overpayment may be recovered from payments due on current active Projects or from any future State work done by the Contractor.

The foregoing provisions of this Section shall be applicable both to the Contractor and the Surety on its Bond; and, in this respect, the Surety shall be bound by the provisions of Subsection 108.09 of these Specifications in the same way and manner as the Contractor.

# A. Interest

In the event the Contractor fails to execute the Standard Release Form as prepared by the Treasurer because he disputes the amount of the final payment as stated therein, the amount due the Contractor shall be deemed by the Contractor and the Department to be an unliquidated sum and no interest shall accrue or be payable on the sum finally determined to be due to the Contractor for any period prior to final determination of such sum, whether such determination be by agreement of the Contractor and the Department or by final judgement of the proper court in the event of litigation between the Department and the Contractor. The Contractor specifically waives and renounces any and all rights it may have under Section 13-6-13 of the Official Code of Georgia and agrees that in the event suit is brought by the Contractor against the Department for any sum claimed by the Contractor under the Contract, for delay damages resulting from a breach of contract, for any breach of contract or for any extra or additional work, no interest shall be awarded on any sum found to be due from the Department to the Contractor in the final judgement entered in such suit. All final judgements shall draw interest at the legal rate, as specified by law. Also, the Contractor agrees that notwithstanding any provision or provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 13 of the Official Code of Georgia that the provisions of this contract control as to when and how the Contractor shall be paid for The Work. Further, the Contractor waives and renounces any and all rights it may have under Chapter 11 of Title 13 of the Official Code of Georgia.

# B. Termination of Department’s Liability

Final payment will be in the amount determined by the statement as due and unpaid. The acceptance of the final payment or execution of the Standard Release Form or failure of the Contractor to act within 120 days as provided herein after tender of payment, or final payment to the Contractor’s Surety in accordance with the provisions stipulated herein, shall operate as and be a release to the Department, the Commissioner, and the Engineer from all claims of liability under this contract and for any act or neglect of the Department, the Commissioner, or the Engineer.

# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

# 109.09 Termination Clause

# A. General

The Department may, by written notice, terminate the Contract or a portion thereof for the Department’s
convenience when the Department determines that the termination is in the State’s best interest, or when the
Contractor is prevented from proceeding with the Contract as a direct result of one of the following conditions:

1. An Executive Order of the President of the United States with respect to the prosecution of war or in the
interest of national defense.
2. The Engineer and Contractor each make a determination, that, due to a shortage of critical materials required
to complete the Work which is caused by allocation of these materials to work of a higher priority by the
Federal Government or any agency thereof, it will be impossible to obtain these materials within a practical
time limit and that it would be in the public interest to discontinue construction.
3. An injunction is imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction which stops the Contractor from proceeding
with the Work and causes a delay of such duration that it is in the public interest to terminate the Contract and
the Contractor was not at fault in creating the condition which led to the court’s injunction.
The decision of the Engineer as to what is in the public interest and as to the Contractor’s fault, for the
purpose of Termination, shall be final.
4. Orders from duly constituted authority relating to energy conservation.

# B. Implementation

When, under any of the conditions set out in Subsection A of this Section, the Contract, or any portion thereof, is
terminated before completion of all Items of Work in the Contract, the Contractor shall be eligible to receive some
or all of the following items of payment:

1. For the actual number of units of Items of Work completed, payment will be made at the Contract Unit Price.
2. Reimbursement for organization of the Work and moving equipment to and from the job will be considered
where the volume of work completed is too small to compensate the Contractor for these expenses under the
Contract Unit Prices. However, the Engineer’s decision as whether or not to reimburse for organization of the
Work and moving equipment to and from the job, and in what amount, shall be final.
3. Acceptable materials, obtained by the Contractor for the work, that have been inspected, tested, and
accepted by the Engineer, and that are not incorporated in the work will, at the request of the Contractor, be
purchased from the Contractor at actual cost as shown by receipted bills and actual cost records at such
points of delivery as may be designated by the Engineer. This will include any materials that have been
delivered to the project site or that have been specifically fabricated for the project and are not readily usable
on other projects. It will not include materials that may have been ordered, but not delivered to the project site
and that are readily usable on other projects (e.g., guard rail, stone, lumber, etc.).
4. For Items of work partially completed, payment adjustments including payments to afford the Contractor a
reasonable profit on work performed, may be made as determined by the Engineer based upon a
consideration of costs actually incurred by the Contractor in attempting to perform the Contract.
5. No payment will be made, and the Department will have no liability, for lost profits on work not performed.
In particular, the Department will not be liable to the Contractor for all profits the Contractor expected to
realize had the Project been completed, nor for any loss of business opportunities, nor for any other
consequential damages.

# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

6. In order that the Department may make a determination of what sums are payable hereunder, the Contractor agrees that, upon termination of the Contract, it will make all of its books and records available for inspection and auditing by the Department. To be eligible for payment, costs must have been actually incurred, and must have been recorded and accounted for according to generally accepted accounting principles and must be items properly payable under Department policies. Where actual equipment costs cannot be established by the auditors, payment for unreimbursed equipment costs will be made in the same manner as is provided in Subsection 109.05 for Force Account work. Idle time for equipment shall be reimbursed at standby rates. In no case will the Contractor be reimbursed for idle equipment after the Engineer has advised the Contractor the equipment is no longer needed on the job. Refusal of the Contractor to allow the Department to inspect and audit all of the Contractor’s books and records shall conclusively establish that the Department has no liability to the Contractor for any payment under this provision and shall constitute a waiver by the Contractor of any claim for damages allegedly caused by breach or termination of the Contract. The amount payable under this provision, if any, is to be determined by the Engineer, whose determination will be final and binding.

7. The sums payable under this Subsection shall be the Contractor’s sole and exclusive remedy for termination of the Contract.

# C. Termination of a Contract

Termination of a Contract or a portion thereof shall not relieve the Contractor of his responsibilities for any completed portion of the Work, nor shall it relieve his Surety of its obligation for and concerning any just claims arising out of the work performed.

# 109.10 Interest

In the event any lawsuit is filed against the Department alleging the Contractor is due additional money because of claims or for any breach of contract, the Contractor hereby waives and renounces any right it may have under O.C.G.A. Section 13-6-13 to prejudgment interest. Also, the Contractor agrees that notwithstanding any provision or provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 13 of the Official Code of Georgia that the provisions of this contract control as to when and how the Contractor shall be paid for The Work. Further, the Contractor waives and renounces any and all rights it may have under Chapter 11 of Title 13 of the Official Code of Georgia.

# 109.11 Price Adjustments

A. Asphalt Cement Price Adjustments will be computed on a monthly basis in accordance with the following:

- PA = Price Adjustment.
- APM = the “Monthly Asphalt Cement Price (Georgia Base Asphalt Price)” for the month the hot mix asphalt/bituminous tack/bituminous surface treatment is placed.
- APL = the “Monthly Asphalt Cement Price (Georgia Base Asphalt Price)” for the month which the project was let.
- TMT = Total Monthly Tonnage of asphalt cement computed by the Engineer based on the Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete of the various types per ton (megagram)//Total Monthly Tonnage of asphalt cement used for bituminous tack coat (asphalt cement tack coat only, emulsified bituminous materials for tack coat are excluded) converted from gallons to tons (megagrams) by the Engineer//Total Monthly Tonnage of asphalt cement used for bituminous surface treatment (total gallons of asphalt emulsion used, as measured from distributors, will be multiplied by a factor of 0.65 to determine the quantity in gallons of asphalt cement used) converted from gallons to tons (megagrams) by the Engineer and certified for payment.

1. If the asphalt cement price for the month is greater than the asphalt cement price for the month in which the project was let to contract, the contractor will be paid an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:

PA = [((APM-APL)/APL)] x TMT x APL



---

# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

If the asphalt cement price for the month is less than the asphalt cement price for the month in which the project was let to contract, the Department will deduct an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:

PA = [((APM-APL)/APL)] x TMT x APL

# a. “Monthly Asphalt Cement Price”

The Department will determine the “Monthly Asphalt Cement Price” based on the following formulas:

Monthly Asphalt Cement Price = 100% Georgia Base Asphalt Price; Where;

GBAP = “Georgia Base Asphalt Price”, (in dollars/ton) is based on the arithmetic average posted price of PG asphalt cement as specified in Section 820, from the Department’s monthly survey obtained from approved asphalt cement suppliers of bituminous materials to the Department projects Free on Board (F.O.B.) the supplier’s terminal. However, the highest price and the lowest price are excluded from the calculation of price, GBAP.

# b. “Asphalt Cement Quantity Calculation”:

The calculation of asphalt cement quantity for each mix type will be based on the asphalt cement content (AC%) of the approved Job Mix Formula (JMF) as specified in Subsection 400.1.03.C. The following calculation formula will be used to determine asphalt cement quantity:

Asphalt Cement Quantity = Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete monthly total in tons (megagrams) per mix type certified for the payment x AC (%)

The Total Monthly Tonnage (TMT) of asphalt cement computed by the Engineer will be calculated as follows:

TMT = Sum of all asphalt cement quantities, including polymer modified asphalt binder and non-modified asphalt cement, based on the Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete of the various mix types per ton (megagram)/ Sum of all asphalt cement quantities used as bituminous tack coat converted from gallons to tons (megagrams)/ Sum of all asphalt cement quantities used for bituminous surface treatment (total gallons of asphalt emulsion used, as measured from distributors, will be multiplied by a factor of 0.65 to determine the quantity in gallons of asphalt cement used) converted from gallons to tons (megagrams) by the Engineer certified for payment.

Asphalt Cement Price for the Month (APM) will be adjusted monthly. Price adjustments (PA) will be made monthly and all calculations for Price Adjustments shall be performed by the Engineer as specified in the Guidelines for Asphalt Cement Price Adjustment located on the Department web site.

# B. Price Adjustment Trigger

No price adjustment will be made on any project with less than 366 Calendar Days from the Contract Letting Date to the specified completion date. If the original Contract contains 366 Calendar Days or more, the Price Adjustment shall be made on quantities placed from the Contract Letting Date to the specified completion date.

# C. Monthly Asphalt Cement Price

The Department will publish a Monthly Asphalt Cement Price based on the formula contained within this specification.

---

# Section 109 — Measurement and Payment

# D. Other Restrictions

1. No asphalt cement price adjustment will be made for cut-back, and emulsified asphalt when used for bituminous tack coat with Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction.
2. There is a cap of 60 percent above the APL for any price adjustment.
3. Unless specifically provided for by Supplemental Agreement or Contract Amendment, no positive Price Adjustments Asphalt Cement that result in a payment to the Contractor will be made after the original Contract Time has expired. Irrespective of any other provisions in the Contract, for purposes of this specification, Contract Time does not include any time extensions or Supplemental Agreements which affect the completion of the Contract. Negative Price Adjustments for Asphalt Cement for any work placed after the original Contract Time expires resulting in a return of funds to the Department will be made and shall be computed based on the Monthly Asphalt Cement Price at the time the Contract Time has expired or the Monthly Asphalt Cement Price at the time the Contract was let, whichever is less.

# E. Final Adjustment

If there are differences between the final audited quantities and the sum of the quantities used to determine the asphalt cement adjustment, the Engineer will make a pro-rated increase or decrease in the price adjustment.

Payment for Price Adjustment will be made under:

# B. Widening and Reconstruction

Before beginning construction where existing pavement is to be retained either for widening or for reconstruction:

1. Take three-point levels of the pavement throughout the length to be retained. Normally, the three-point levels will be required at 50 ft. (15 m) intervals. However, the Engineer may adjust these intervals according to existing field conditions. Three-point levels are not required on asphalt shoulder widening projects and earth shoulder reconstruction projects.
2. From the three-point levels, prepare a graphic grade plot that “best fits” the existing pavement to minimize the leveling requirements (if any) of the existing roadway. Cross slopes may be varied within the ranges shown on the plans or adjusted by the Engineer to produce the “best fit.”
3. On passing lane or widening Projects where existing pavement is not to be overlaid:

Profile and plot the outside edge of the existing pavement to obtain a smooth profile grade.
4. Transfer this grade to the new edge of paving using the proper cross slope.

Furnish data to the Engineer for approval before beginning widening and reconstruction.
On widening, reconstruction, or passing lane projects, obtain the Engineer’s approval of the “best fit” profile. Ensure that grade stakes are set to control the construction of any required widening based upon the “best fit” profile and cross slope. Construct proposed widening flush with the existing edge of paving. Provide positive drainage in all cases.

# C. Existing Bridge Widening or Modification

To widen or modify existing bridges, do the following before ordering materials or beginning construction:

1. Verify existing elevations and dimensions as well as confirm or determine required new cap elevations.

# I. Maintain the Stakes

After construction has begun in any segment of the project, maintain the stakes that identify construction station numbers and locations as follows:

1. Ensure that stakes are placed at intervals not to exceed 200 ft. (60 m) and use even, 100 ft. (30 m) stations. On asphalt shoulder widening and earth shoulder reconstruction projects use mile post numbers when stations are not used. Mark and flag stakes so that they are visible to DOT Project personnel in that segment of the project until construction is complete. Projects utilizing GPS controlled fine grading equipment, place stakes at intervals not to exceed 300 ft. (91 m) on English projects and 100 m (310 ft.) on metric projects. Use even, 100 ft. (30 m) or 100 m (310 ft.), stations.
2. During grading activities in fills or cuts over 20 ft. (6 m), extend slope stakes up or down the slopes in intervals of 10 ft. (3 m) or less to achieve an accurate cross section.
3. Denote the offset distance to the construction centerline on the station number stakes, when the station number is maintained in a location other than on the construction centerline. On asphalt shoulder widening and earth shoulder reconstruction projects use the offset to the edge of pavement on the stakes.

# J. Traffic Markings

When traffic markings are to be placed by either the Contractor or others, furnish the layout and clean and pre-line the surface to allow the placement of permanent pavement markings on the project. When traffic markings are not included in the project plans, the Department will provide striping plans and/or standard drawings for the Contractor’s use.

# 157.3.05 Construction

# A. Location of Base Lines, Triangulation Stations, and Survey Targets

Possible locations of base lines, triangulation stations, and survey targets are shown on the plans. Timber walkways are included as a bid item, but their locations may not be shown on the plans. Actual and final locations of survey aids are based upon Contractors’ own procedures and equipment methods.

The Contractor and the Engineer must agree on the most effective means to control the line and distance during construction. At the Preconstruction Conference, discuss with the Subcontractors the plan of operation for reaching this consensus.

After the conference, the plans will be modified to show the locations of base lines and the number and locations of triangulation stations and survey targets. Timber walkway locations may not be shown on the modified plans.

After receiving the modified plans, make survey aids construction the first operation, including the installation of timber walkways if needed to provide access.

# B. Location of Survey Points

After the Contractor constructs survey aids, the Engineer places instrument mountings and performs field checks and office calculations necessary to provide the location of the survey points.

Even though electronic data methods are used to calculate the point locations, the Engineer may not be able to designate survey point locations immediately. Time Charges will not be suspended during this period.

# C. Clearing and Grubbing

The Engineer must be satisfied with the method and the location of all clearing and grubbing necessary for survey aid construction as a part of this work. Dispose of removed materials as directed by the Engineer.

# D. Framing

Perform all framing and construct survey aids according to the Plan details, unless the Engineer permits alternate details.

Section 157 — Survey Aids

# E. Triangulation Stations

Drive pile clusters into the underlying firm material to provide instrument mountings. Ensure that these mountings are steady enough to use during wind and wave conditions.

# F. Survey Targets

Drive the piling into the firm material to provide and maintain accuracy of the targets under weather and construction conditions specific to the project area.

# G. Timber Walkways

Drive piling deep enough to provide stability under weather and construction conditions specific to the project area. Walkways may be required to provide access to triangulation stations, to provide access to boats located at the edge of marsh or swamp areas at low water or low tide periods, or for other purposes as designated on the plans or by the Engineer. Alternate designs will be considered if they have equal strength, width, and safety.

# H. Height Control

Regardless of elevations stated or implied on the Plans or in the Contract, the Engineer can determine how high to construct the survey aids. Construct items above the extreme high-tide mark. The Engineer may require triangulation stations used initially for roadway item control to be built higher. These higher stations may be used in bridge control that may be in the initial or subsequent Contracts. Constructing railing ladders and other vertical means of access are considered incidental to constructing survey aids.

# 157.3.06 Quality Acceptance

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 157.3.07 Contractor Warranty and Maintenance

Maintain the survey aids as follows:

- A. Promptly replace, repair, or strengthen defective, unduly worn, corroded, deteriorated, or otherwise unsatisfactory material at the Engineer’s request. Such maintenance is incidental to survey aid construction.
- B. Maintain survey aids to the Engineer’s satisfaction to ensure that they are safe, have longevity, and perform accurately.
- C. If a survey aid will be used to control the work under another Contract:
- 1. Do not remove that aid.
- 2. Before moving off the project or before relinquishing maintenance to another Contractor, perform the maintenance required to leave the aid in serviceable use for the future Work. The Engineer must approve of the maintenance. The additional maintenance is considered incidental to survey aid construction.

The subsequent Contractor’s maintenance period will conclude when the survey aids no longer are needed for the duration of the Contract. The subsequent Contractor shall maintain the survey aids to the Engineer’s satisfaction needed for Work, as provided in Subsection 105.05, Cooperation by Contractor as incidental to the work. When the aids no longer are needed the Engineer will advise the responsible Contractor. The Contractor who used the aids last shall remove and dispose of the material to the Engineer’s satisfaction. Removal and disposal is incidental to the work.

- a. Harvest the sprigs using a sod cutter, turning plow, or other approved equipment so that at least 3 in. (75 mm) of the root system is lifted intact.
- b. Immediately load the harvested sprigs and cover them with wet burlap or canvas to prevent weather damage.
- c. Transport the sprigs to where they will be immediately planted or stockpiled.
- d. Plant sprigs within 48 hours after they are harvested. Never allow sprigs to dry out or freeze.

# H. Apply Sprigs

Apply sprigs using either the broadcast or row method. However, do not perform broadcast sprigging on steep slopes or narrow areas where results will not be satisfactory. During sprigging, ensure that the soil moisture content is at least the optimum for soil sprigging.

# 1. Broadcast Sprigging

Perform broadcast sprigging as follows:

- a. Apply the sprigs mechanically or by hand in a uniform layer over the prepared surface placing at least 4 viable sprigs to each square foot (43 viable sprigs to each square meter).
- b. Place the sprigs 2 to 3 in. (50 to 75 mm) deep by disc harrowing or by other satisfactory means.

# 2. Row Sprigging

Perform row sprigging as follows:

- a. Open furrows spaced at least 1 ft. (300 mm) apart to at least 4 in. (100 mm) deep.
- b. Immediately place the sprigs in the furrows by hand or by planting machines and overlap them in the furrows.
- c. Do not expose sprigs more than 15 minutes before filling in the furrows.

# I. Restore Line and Grade, and Roll

After the sprigging is done, do the following:

- 1. Return the impaired sections back to the line and grade as established by the Engineer.
- 2. Roll the area at right angles to the direction of the slope incline.

# J. Mulch Sprigged Areas

Mulch sprigged areas within the construction limits according to Subsection 700.3.05.G, Mulching.

- 1. Mulch with Binder: When applying mulch with binder, apply immediately after the over-seeding and rolling are complete.
- 2. Mixed-in-Place Mulch: When applying mixed-in-place mulch, apply immediately after sprigging.

# 160.3.06 Quality Acceptance

Before Final Acceptance, each planted area shall meet the requirements for satisfactory growth and development as defined in Subsection 160.5.01.A, Plant Establishment. Except as otherwise specified in this specification, all seeding shall conform to Section 700, and pine seedling planting shall conform to Section 702.

When the repair does not require a new or replacement BMP or significant repair, the BMP failure or deficiency must be corrected by the close of the next business day from the time of discovery. If the correction requires a new or replacement BMP or significant repair, the correction must be completed and operational within seven (7) days from the time of discovery. If seven (7) days is infeasible, the Contractor must document the reasons why the timeframe is infeasible and coordinate with the Engineer to schedule the correction as soon as feasible after the seven (7) day timeframe. The Department must be in agreement with the infeasibility assessment.

# B. Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Plan

1. # Project Plans

An Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan (ESPCP) for the construction of the project will be provided by the Department. The ESPCP will be prepared for the various stages of construction necessary to complete the project. If the Contractor elects to alter the stage construction from that shown in the plans, it will be the responsibility of the Contractor to have the plans revised and prepared in accordance with the current GAR100002 NPDES permit by a Design Professional to reflect all changes in Staging. This will also include any revisions to erosion and sedimentation control item quantities. If the changes affect the Comprehensive Monitoring Program (CMP), the Contractor will be responsible for any revisions to the CMP as well. Submit revised plans and quantities to the Engineer for review prior to land disturbing activities.
2. # Haul Roads, Borrow Pits, Excess Material Pits, etc.

The Contractor is responsible for amending the approved erosion, sedimentation and control plans if they add a haul road that is outside of the project roadway but within the right of way or construct any borrow pits, or excess material pits inside the Right of Way. Prepare these plans for all stages of construction and include the appropriate items and quantities. Submit these plans to the Engineer for review prior to land disturbing activities. These plans are to be prepared by a Design Professional.

If construction of haul roads, or borrow pits, or excess material pits, etc., (inside the Right of Way) encroach within the 25 foot (7.6 m) buffer along the banks of all state waters or within the 50 ft. (15 m) buffer along the banks of any state waters classified as a “trout stream”, a state water buffer variance must be obtained by the Contractor prior to beginning any land disturbing activity in the stream buffer.
3. # Erosion Control for Borrow and Excess Material Pits Outside the Right-of-Way

Erosion control for borrow pits and excess material pits outside the right of way is the responsibility of the Contractor. If borrow or excess material pits require coverage under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit (NPDES) or other permits or variances are required, submit a copy of all documentation required by the permitting agency to the Engineer. All costs associated with complying with local, state, and federal laws and regulations are the responsibility of the Contractor.

Section 161 — Control of Soil Erosion and Sedimentation

# D. Implement Permanent or Temporary Erosion Control

1. Silt fence shown along the perimeter, e.g. right of way, and sediment containment devices, e.g. sediment basins, shall be installed prior to major clearing and grubbing operations. Minor clearing and grubbing are allowed for the sole purpose of installing perimeter controls and other initial phase BMPs.
2. Incorporate permanent erosion control features into the Project at the earliest practicable time, e.g. velocity dissipation, permanent ditch protection.
3. Use temporary erosion control measures to address minor conditions that develop during construction, e.g. between construction stages.
4. Use temporary erosion control measures when installation of permanent erosion control features cannot be accomplished.

The Engineer has the authority to:

- Limit the surface area of erodible earth material exposed by clearing and grubbing.
- Limit the surface area of erodible earth material exposed by excavation and borrow and fill operations.
- Limit the area of excavation, and embankment operations in progress to correspond with the Contractor’s ability to keep the finish grading, mulching, seeding, and other permanent erosion control measures current.
- Direct the Contractor to provide immediate permanent or temporary erosion control to prevent contamination of adjacent streams or water courses, lakes, ponds, or other areas of water impoundment.

Such Work may include constructing items listed in the table in Subsection 161.1.02.A, Related References or other control devices or methods to control erosion.

# E. Erodible Area

NOTE: Never allow the surface area of erodible earth material exposed at one time to exceed 17 acres (7 ha) except as approved by the State Construction Engineer.

The maximum of 17 acres (7 ha) of exposed erodible earth applies to the entire Project and to all of its combined operations as a whole, not to the exposed erodible earth of each individual operation.

Upon receipt of a written request from the contractor the State Construction Engineer, or his designee, will review; the request, any justifications and the Project conditions for waiver of the 17 acres (7 ha) limitation. If the 17 acre limitation is increased by the State Construction Engineer, the WECS shall not be assigned to another project in that capacity and should remain on site each work day that the exposed acreage exceeds 17 acres.

After installing temporary erosion control devices, e.g., grassing, mulching, stabilizing an area, and having it approved by the Engineer, that area will be released from the 17 acres (7 ha) limit.

# F. Perform Grading Operations

Perform the following grading operations:

1. Whenever practicable, complete each roadway cut and embankment continuously.
2. Maintain the top of the earthwork in roadway sections throughout the construction stages to allow water to run off to the outer edges, including techniques to minimize concentrated flow.
3. Provide temporary slope drain facilities with inlets and velocity dissipaters (straw bales, silt fence, aprons, etc.) to carry the runoff water to the bottom of the slopes. Place drains at intervals to handle the accumulated water.
4. Continue temporary erosion control measures until permanent drainage facilities have been constructed, pavement placed, and the grass on planted slopes stabilized to deter erosion.

# Section 161 — Control of Soil Erosion and Sedimentation

# G. Perform Construction in Rivers and Streams

Perform construction in river and stream beds as follows:

1. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Engineer, restrict construction operations in rivers, streams, and impoundments to areas where channel changes or access for construction are shown on the Plans to construct temporary or permanent structures.
2. If channel changes or diversions are not shown on the Plans, the Contractor shall develop diversion plans prepared in accordance with the current GAR100002 NPDES Infrastructure Construction permit utilizing a design professional as defined within the permit. The Engineer will review prepared diversion plans for content only and accepts no responsibility for design errors or omissions. Amendments will be made part of the project plans by attachment. Include any associated costs in the price bid for the overall contract. Any contract time associated with the submittal or its review and subsequent response will not be considered for an extension of Contract time. All time associated with this subsection shall be considered incidental.
3. If additional access for construction or removal of work bridges, temporary roads/access or work platforms is necessary, and will require additional encroachment upon river or stream banks and bottoms, the contractor shall prepare a plan in accordance with the current GAR100002 NPDES Infrastructure Construction permit utilizing a design professional as defined within the permit. Plans should be submitted at least 12 weeks prior to the date the associated work is expected to begin. If necessary, the plan will be provided to the appropriate regulating authority, e.g. United States Army Corps of Engineers by the Department for consideration and approval. No work that impacts areas beyond what has been shown in the approved plans will be allowed to begin until written approval of the submitted plan has been provided by the Department. Approved plan amendments will be made part of the project plans by attachment. Include any associated costs in the price bid for the overall contract. Any contract time associated with the submittal or its review and subsequent response will not be considered for an extension of Contract time. All time associated with this subsection shall be considered incidental.
4. Clear rivers, streams, and impoundments of the following as soon as conditions permit:
- Falsework
- Piling that is to be removed
- Debris
- Other obstructions placed or caused by construction operations
5. Do not ford live streams with construction equipment.
6. Use temporary bridges or other structures that are adequate for a 25-year storm for stream crossings. Include costs in the price bid for the overall contract.
7. Do not operate mechanized equipment in live streams except to construct channel changes or temporary or permanent structures, and to remove temporary structures, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Engineer.

# H. State Water Buffers and Environmental Restrictions

1. The WECS shall review the plans and contract documents for environmental restrictions, Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA), e.g. buffers, etc prior to performing land disturbing activities.
2. The WECS shall ensure all parties performing land disturbing activities within the project limits are aware of all environmental restrictions.
3. Buffer delineation shall be performed prior to clearing, or any other land disturbing activities. Site conditions may require temporary delineation measures to be implemented prior to the installation of orange barrier/safety fencing. The means of temporary delineation shall have the Engineer’s prior approval.
4. The WECS shall allow the Engineer to review the buffer delineation prior to performing any land disturbing activities, including but not limited to clearing, grubbing and thinning of vegetation. Any removal and relocation of buffer delineation based upon the Engineer’s review will not be measured for separate payment.
5. The WECS shall advise the Engineer of any surface water(s) encountered that are not shown in the plans. The WECS shall prevent land disturbing activities from occurring within surface water buffers until the Engineer provides approval to proceed.

# Section 161 — Control of Soil Erosion and Sedimentation

# I. Maintenance Projects

Projects that consist of asphalt resurfacing, shoulder reconstruction and/or shoulder widening; schedule and perform the construction of the project to comply with the following:

1. After temporary and permanent erosion control devices are installed and the area permanently stabilized (temporary or permanent) and approved by the Engineer, the area may be released from the 1 acre (0.4 ha) limit.
2. The maximum of 1 acre (0.4 ha) of erodible earth applies to the entire project and to all combined operations, including borrow and excess material operations that are within the right of way, not 1 acre (0.4 ha) of exposed erodible earth for each operation.
3. Do not allow the disturbed exposed erodible area to exceed 1 acre (0.4 ha). This 1 acre (0.4 ha) limit includes all disturbed areas relating to the construction of the project including but not limited to slope and shoulder construction.
4. At the end of each working day, permanently stabilize all of the area disturbed by slope and shoulder reconstruction to prevent any contamination of adjacent streams or other watercourses, lakes, ponds or other areas of water impoundment. For purposes of this Specification, the end of the working day is defined as when the construction operations cease. For example, 6:00 a.m. is the end of the working day on a project that allows work only between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.)
5. Stabilize the cut and fill slopes and shoulder with permanent or temporary grassing and a Wood Fiber Blanket (Section 713, Type II). Mulching is not allowed. Borrow pits, soil disposal sites and haul roads will not require daily applications of wood fiber blanket. The application rate for the Wood Fiber Blanket on shoulder reconstruction is the rate specified for Shoulders. For shoulder reconstruction, the ground preparation requirements of Subsection 700.3.05.A.1 are waived. Preparation consists of scarifying the existing shoulders 4 to 6 in. (100 to 150 mm) deep and leaving the area in a smooth uniform condition free from stones, lumps, roots or other material.
6. If a sudden rain event occurs that would not allow the Contractor to apply the Type II Wood Fiber Blanket per Section 713, install Wood Fiber Blanket Type I per Section 713 if directed by the Engineer. Wood Fiber Blanket Type I application is for emergency use only.
7. Install temporary grass or permanent grass according to seasonal limitations and Specifications. When temporary grass is used, use the over seeding method (Subsection 700.3.05.E.4) when planting permanent grass.
8. Remove and dispose of all material excavated for the trench widening operation at an approved soil disposal site by the end of each working day. When shoulder reconstruction is required, this material may be used to reconstruct the graded shoulder after all asphaltic concrete pavement has been placed.
9. Provide immediate permanent and/or temporary erosion control measures for borrow pits, soil disposal sites and haul roads to prevent any contamination of adjacent streams or other watercourses, lakes, ponds or other areas of water impoundment.
10. Place asphalt in the trench the same day as the excavation occurs. Place asphalt or concrete in driveways and side roads being re-graded the same day as the excavation occurs. Stabilize any disturbed or exposed soil that is not covered with asphalt with a Wood Fiber Blanket (and grass seed). Payment will be made for the Wood Fiber Blanket and grass seed only if the shoulder has been constructed to final dimensions and grade and no further grading will be required.
11. Do not allow the grading (height of cut or fill) to exceed the operating range of the grassing equipment.
12. When grading operations or other soil disturbing activities are suspended, regardless of the reason, promptly perform all necessary permanent stabilization and/or erosion control work.
13. Use temporary erosion control measures to:
- Correct conditions that develop during construction but were unforeseen during the design stage.
- Use as needed before installing permanent erosion control features.
- Temporarily control erosion that develops during normal construction practices but are not associated with permanent control features on the Project.
14. When conditions warrant, such as unfavorable weather (rain event), the Engineer may require more frequent intervals for this work.

Use temporary grass in the following situations:

- When required by the Specifications or directed by the Engineer to control erosion where permanent grassing cannot be planted.
- To protect an area for longer than mulch is expected to last (60 calendar days), plant temporary grass as follows:

1. Use seeds that conform to Subsection 890.2.01, Seed. Perform seeding according to Section 700; except use the minimum ground preparation necessary to provide a seed bed if further grading is required.
2. Prepare areas that require no further grading according to Subsection 700.3.05.A, Ground Preparation. Omit the lime unless the area will be planted with permanent grass without further grading. In this case, apply the lime according to Section 700.
3. Apply mixed grade fertilizer at 400 lbs./acre (450 kg/ha). Omit the nitrogen. Mulch (with straw or hay) temporary grass according to Section 700. (Erosion control compost Mulch will not be allowed with grassing.)
4. Before planting permanent grass, thoroughly plow and prepare areas where temporary grass has been planted according to Subsection 700.3.05.A, Ground Preparation.
5. Apply Polyacrylamide (PAM) to all areas that receive temporary grassing.
6. Apply PAM (powder) before grassing or PAM (emulsion) to the hydroseeding operation.

Apply mulch as follows:

1. Mulch (Hay or Straw) - Without Grass Seed
1. Uniformly spread the mulch over the designated areas from 2 in. to 4 in. (50 mm to 100 mm) thick.
2. After spreading the mulch, walk in the mulch by using a tracked vehicle (preferred method), empty sheep foot roller, light disking, or other means that preserves the finished cross section of the prepared areas. The Engineer will approve of the method.
3. Place temporary mulch on slopes as steep as 2:1 by using a tracked vehicle to imbed the mulch into the slope.
4. When grassing operations begin, leave the mulch in place and plow the mulch into the soil during seed bed preparation. The mulch will become beneficial plant food for the newly planted grass.
2. Erosion control compost - Without Grass Seed
1. Uniformly spread the mulch (erosion control compost) over the designated areas 2 in. (50 mm) thick.
2. When rolling is necessary, or directed by the Engineer, use a light corrugated drum roller.
3. When grassing operations begin, leave the mulch in place and plow the mulch into the soil during seed bed preparation. The mulch will become beneficial plant food for the newly planted grass.
4. Plant temporary grass on area stabilized with mulch (erosion control compost) after 60 calendar days.

# 167.3.05 Construction

# A. General

Perform inspections, rainfall data collection, testing of samples, and reporting the test results on the project according to the requirements in Part IV of the NPDES Infrastructure Permit and this Specification. Take samples manually or use automatic samplers, according to the GAR100002 Permit. Note that the GAR100002 Permit requires the use of manual sampling or rising stage sampling for qualifying events that occur after the first instance of the automatic sampler not being activated during a qualifying event. Analyze all samples according to the Permit, regardless of the method used to collect the samples. If samples are analyzed in the field using portable turbidimeters, the monitoring results shall state they are being used and a digital readout of NTUs is what is provided. Submit bench sheets, work sheets, etc., when using portable turbidimeters. There are no exceptions to this requirement. Perform required inspections and submit all reports required by this Specification within the time frames specified. Failure to perform the inspections within the time specified will result in the cessation of all construction activities with the exception of traffic control and erosion control. Failure to submit the required reports within the times specified will result in non-refundable deductions as specified in Subsection 161.5.01.B.

# B. Water Quality Inspections

The Department will provide one copy of the required inspection forms for use and duplication. Inspection forms may change during the contract to reflect regulatory agency needs or the need of the Department. Any costs associated with the change of inspection forms shall be considered incidental. Alternate formats of the provided forms may be created, used and submitted by the Contractor provided the required content and/or data fields and verbatim certification statements from the Department’s current forms are included.

The Engineer shall inspect the installation and condition of each erosion control device required by the erosion control plan within seven days after initial installation. This inspection is performed for each stage of construction when new devices are installed. The WECS shall ensure all installation deficiencies reported by the Engineer are corrected within two business days.

Ensure the inspections of the areas listed below are conducted by certified personnel and at the frequencies listed. Document all inspections on the appropriate form provided by the Department.

1. Daily (when any work is occurring):
- Petroleum product storage, usage and handling areas for spills or leaks from vehicles or equipment.
- All locations where vehicles enter/exit the site for evidence of off-site sediment tracking.

Continue these inspections until a Notice of Termination (NOT) is submitted and use the daily inspection forms.



---

# Section 167 — Water Quality Monitoring

# 2. Weekly and after Rainfall Events:

Conduct inspections on these areas every seven calendar days and within twenty-four hours after the end of a rainfall event that is 0.5 in (13 mm) or greater (unless such storm ends after 5:00 PM on any Friday or any non-working Saturday, non-working Sunday or any non-working Federal holiday in which case the inspection shall be completed by the end of the next business day and/or working day, whichever occurs first):

- a. Disturbed areas not permanently stabilized
- b. Material storage areas that are exposed to precipitation or stormwater and poses a risk to discharging pollutants
- c. Structural control measures, Best Management Practices (BMPs) to ensure they are operating correctly
- d. Water quality sampling locations and equipment
- e. Discharge locations or points, e.g., outfalls and drainage structures that are accessible to determine if erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters

Continue these inspections until all temporary BMPs are removed and a NOT is submitted and use the EC-1 Form.

# 3. Monthly:

Once per month, inspect all areas where final stabilization has been completed. Look for evidence of sediments or pollutants entering the drainage system and or receiving waters. Inspect all permanent erosion control devices remaining in place to verify the maintenance status and that the devices are functioning properly. Inspect discharge locations or points, e.g. outfalls, drainage structures, that are accessible to determine if erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters. Continue these inspections until the Notice of Termination is submitted and use the monthly inspection form.

# C. Water Quality Sampling

When the sampling location is a receiving water, the upstream and downstream samples are taken for comparison of NTU values. When the sampling location is an outfall, a single sample is taken to be analyzed for its absolute NTU value.

---

# Section 167 — Water Quality Monitoring

# D. Reports

# 1. Inspection Reports:

Summarize the results of inspections noted above in writing on the appropriate Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or EC-1 form provided by the Department and includes the following information:

- Date(s) of inspection
- Name of certified personnel performing inspection
- Construction phase
- Status of devices
- Observations
- Action taken in accordance with Part IV.D.4.a.(5) of the GAR100002 Permit
- Signature of personnel performing the inspection
- Any instance of non-compliance

When the report does not identify any non-compliance instances, the inspection report shall contain a statement that the best management practices are in compliance with the Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan. (See the EC-1 form.)

The reports shall be made and retained at the site or be readily available at a designated alternate location until the entire site or that portion of a construction project that has been phased has undergone final stabilization and a Notice of Termination is submitted to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division (GAEPD). Such reports shall be readily available by the end of the second business day and/or working day and shall identify all incidents of best management practices that have not been properly installed and/or maintained as described in the plan. The inspection form certification sheet shall be signed by the project WECS and the inspector performing inspections on behalf of the WECS (if not the same person). Submit all inspection reports to the Engineer within twenty-four hours of the inspection. The Engineer will review the submitted reports to determine their accuracy. The Engineer will notify the certified personnel of any additional items that should be added to the inspection report.

Complete any items listed in the inspection report requiring routine maintenance within seventy–two (72) hours of notification or immediately during perimeter BMP failure emergencies. Deficiencies that interfere with traffic flow, safety, or downstream turbidity shall have immediate reasonable steps taken to address the deficiencies.

BMP(s) that has failed or is deficient beyond routine maintenance and has resulted in sediment deposition into waters of the State shall have immediate reasonable steps taken to address the condition, including but not limited to cleaning up any contaminated surfaces so the sediment material will not discharge in subsequent storm events. When the repair does not require a new or replacement BMP or significant repair, the BMP failure or deficiency must be corrected by the close of the next business day from the time of discovery. If the correction requires a new or replacement BMP or significant repair, the correction must be completed and operational within seven (7) days from the time of discovery. If seven (7) days is infeasible, the Contractor must document why the timeframe is infeasible and coordinate with the Engineer to schedule the correction as soon as feasible after the seven (7) day timeframe. The Department must be in agreement with the infeasibility assessment.

Assume responsibility for all costs associated with additional sampling as specified in Part IV.D.6.d.3.(c) of the NPDES GAR100002 Permit if either of these conditions arise:

- BMPs shown in the Plans are not properly installed and maintained, or
- BMPs designed by the Contractor are not properly designed, installed and maintained.

---

# Section 167 — Water Quality Monitoring

# 2. Sampling Reports

# a. All sampling

All sampling shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of the GAR100002 Permit for the locations identified in the ESPCP approved by the Department.

# b. Report Requirements

Include in all reports, the following certification statement, signed by the WECS or consultant providing sampling on the project:

“I certify under penalty of law that this report and all attachments were prepared under my direct supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that certified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.”

When a rainfall event requires a sample to be taken, submit a report of the sampling results to the Engineer within seven working days of the date the sample was obtained. Include the following information in each report:

1. Date and time of sampling
2. Name of certified person(s) who performed the sampling and analyses.
3. Date the analyses were performed
4. Time the analyses were initiated
5. Rainfall amount on the sampling date (sampling date only)
6. References and written procedures, when available, for the analytical techniques or methods used.
7. Whether the samples were taken by automatic sampler, rising-stage sampler, or manually (grab sample)
8. The NTU of each sample, the results of the analyses, including the bench sheets, instrument readouts, computer disks or tapes, etc., used to determine the results
9. Location where each sample was taken (station number and left or right offset)
10. Identification of whether a sample is a receiving-water sample or an outfall sample
11. Project number and county
12. A clear note if a sample exceeds 1000 NTUs by writing “exceeds 1000 NTUs” prominently upon the report

# c. Report Requirements with No Qualifying Rainfall Events

In the event a qualifying rainfall event does not produce a discharge to sample, or sampling is “impossible”, as defined in the GAR1000002 Permit, a written justification must be included in the report as required at Part IV.D.4.a.(6) of the GAR100002 Permit.

# d. Sampling Results

Provide sampling results to the Project Engineer within 48 hours of the samples being analyzed. This notification may be verbal or written. This notification does not replace the requirement to submit the formal summary to the Engineer within 7 working days of the samples being collected. The Engineer will ensure submission of the sampling report to GAEPD by the 15th of the month following the sampling results as per the GAR100002 Permit. The WECS will be held accountable for delayed delivery to the Department which results in late submissions to GAEPD resulting in enforcement actions.

---

# Section 167 — Water Quality Monitoring

# 3. Rainfall Data Reports:

Record the measurement of rainfall within disturbed areas that have not met final stabilization once each 24-hour period, except for non-working Saturdays, non-working Sundays and non-working Federal Holidays until a Notice of Termination is submitted. Project rain gauges and those used to trigger the automatic samplers are to be emptied after every rainfall event. This will prevent a cumulative effect and prevent automatic samplers from taking samples even though the rainfall event is not a qualifying event. The daily rainfall data supplied by the WECS to the Engineer will be the official rainfall data for the project for compliance with the permit.

Required inspections and reports after Contract Time has expired will not be measured for payment unless a time extension is granted. Water Quality Sampling is measured per each. “Each” means each qualifying rainfall sampling event, not each sampled site.

# 167.4.01 Limits

General Provisions 101 through 150. Submit the monitoring summary report to the Engineer within 7 working days.

# 167.5 Payment

Payment for Water Quality Inspections and Water Quality Sampling will be made as follows:

Water Quality Inspections will be paid at the Contract Price per month. This is full compensation for performing the requirements of the inspection section of the NPDES Permit and this Specification, any and all necessary incidentals, and providing results of inspections to the Engineer, within the time frame required by the NPDES Infrastructure Permit, and this Specification.

Water Quality Monitoring and Sampling per each qualifying rainfall sampling event is full compensation for meeting the requirements of the monitoring sections of the NPDES Permit and this Specification, obtaining samples, analyzing samples, any and all necessary incidentals, and providing results of turbidity tests to the Engineer, within the time frame required by the NPDES Infrastructure Permit, and this Specification. This item is based on the rainfall events requiring sampling as described in Part IV.D.6 of the Permit. The Department will not pay for samples taken and analyzed for rainfall events that are not qualifying events as compared to the daily rainfall data supplied by the WECS.

Install the silt fence according to this Specification, as shown on the plans, or as directed by the Engineer.

1. Install Silt Fence
1. Install silt fence by either of the following methods:
1. Excavated Trench Method
Excavate a trench 4 to 6 in. (100 to 150 mm) deep using equipment such as a trenching machine or motor grader. If equipment cannot be operated on the site, excavate the trench by hand.
2. Soil Slicing Method
Create a mechanical slice in the soil 8 to 12 in. (200 to 300 mm) deep to receive the silt fence. Ensure the width of the slice is not more than 3 in. (75 mm). Mechanically insert the silt fence fabric into the slice in a simultaneous operation with the slicing ensuring consistent depth and placement.
2. Install the first post at the center of the low point (if applicable). Space the remaining posts a maximum of 6 ft. (1.8 m) apart for Types A and B fence and 4 ft. (1.2 m) apart for Type C fence.
3. Bury the posts at least 18 in. (450 mm) into the ground. If this depth cannot be attained, secure the posts enough to prevent the fence from overturning from sediment loading.

# Section 205 — Roadway Excavation

# 205.2 Materials

Define excavated material, regardless of its nature or composition, as “unclassified excavation” unless otherwise specified in the Plans. The Engineer will designate materials that are unsuitable.

# 205.2.01 Delivery, Storage, and Handling

# A. Disposal of Surplus Material

Unless directed by the Engineer, do not waste excavated material until satisfying embankment and backfill requirements, unless material is designated on the Plans as “Unsuitable for embankment or backfill construction.” Dispose of materials to be wasted according to Subsection 201.3.05.E and the following information:

- Use suitable surplus material to widen embankments uniformly or to flatten fill slopes, or deposit the material in places on the Right-of-Way as directed by the Engineer.
- Do not leave an unsightly pile of material that will damage abutting property or deposit material above the grade of the adjacent roadway unless so directed by the Engineer.
- Do not place the edge of a waste bank nearer than 10 ft. (3 m) from the top of a cut slope.

Dispose of unsuitable and surplus materials unless they are used as fill for slopes, abandoned ditches, or other areas shown on the Plans.

- Deposit unsuitable material excavated from ditches and do not allow it to remain within 3 ft (1 m) of the ditch edge. Spread material neatly in level, uniform layers.
- Use suitable materials from ditches for constructing roadway embankments unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.

# B. Waste Disposal Areas

When unable to dispose of unsuitable or surplus excavation material on the Right-of-Way, dispose of it in the following areas:

1. Disposal Areas Shown on Plans
Check disposal areas shown on the Plans. They may or may not be adjacent to the Right-of-Way. When shown on the Plans, the Department will obtain Right-of-Way or easement to permit disposal of material. The Plans contain the amounts of royalties and the conditions for the acquiring of the waste easement.

When the Department furnishes the waste areas, and the Engineer provides measurements of the area used, do the following:

- Promptly pay royalties to the owners of waste pits.
- Meet other conditions agreed to with the owners.
- Submit to the Engineer a written statement signed by the owner stating that the owner has been paid in full and the agreed conditions, including proper draining and final clean-up, have been fulfilled to the owner’s satisfaction before receiving final payment from the Department.

The Department will not make separate payment for these costs of acquisition. If the property owner is not paid within 60 days after the Engineer has furnished the measurement, the Department may pay the property owner directly any amounts due, and deduct it from funds due the Contractor. This provision does not affect the obligation of the Contractor under his bond or the rights of the property owner or the Department under the bond. In case of dispute between the Contractor and the Department, the Chief Engineer will make the final and conclusive decision. When disposal areas are shown on the Plans and are elected to be used, comply with the terms of the option before resorting to other areas.

---

# Section 205 — Roadway Excavation

# 2. Disposal Areas Not Shown on Plans

When waste disposal areas are not shown on the Plans, obtain suitable disposal areas at no expense to the Department. Exercise the right to sell or otherwise dispose of the surplus material in these cases. (See Subsection 107.22 and Subsection 107.23.)

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 205.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 205.3.05 Construction

Perform roadway excavation according to the Plans, and all of the requirements of this Subsection.

1. Provide adequate openings in spoil banks to allow the adjacent land surface to drain.
2. To carry water from the side hill, cut surface ditches at the top of cut slopes that extend to each end of the cuts.
3. Turn side ditches or gutters that empty from cuts to embankments outward to avoid embankment erosion.
4. Discharge water from surface ditches at terraces or in tail ditches cut along contour lines (wherever possible).
5. Provide outlets or flumes for roadway ditches where necessary according to the Plans.
6. Surface ditches, outlets, and other such ditches will be paid for as “unclassified excavation.”
7. Uniformly round the intersection of cut slopes with natural ground surfaces, including the beginning and end of cut slopes.
8. Bring cut slopes to the grade and cross-section shown on the Plans or established by the Engineer.
9. Finish to reasonably uniform surfaces acceptable for seeding and mulching operations.
10. Dispose of material from slides and overbreaks that occur before Final Acceptance as directed by the Engineer.

# A. Constructing Serrated Slopes

Construct serrated slopes as follows:

1. Grade the backslope according to the Construction Detail. The pay line is the template line or the final staked cross-section slope line. The Department will not make additional measurement or payment for constructing serrated slopes.
2. Start the first serration (step) as designated on the Construction Detail. Ensure that it is level instead of parallel to the roadway grade.
3. Use the tilt-control blade bulldozer to cut steps in alternate directions.

---

Section 205 — Roadway Excavation

B. Constructing Non-serrated Slopes

Construct non-serrated slopes by leaving the front and back slopes in a roughened condition to provide a seed bed for temporary or permanent grassing operations.

C. Erosion and Siltation Control

Take the measures necessary throughout the Project to control erosion and to prevent silting of rivers, streams, and impoundments. Construct drainage facilities and perform all other construction work that contributes to erosion and siltation control in conjunction with earthwork operations as required by Section 161.

D. Rock Excavation

Remove rock and dispose of it as shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer. Transition any flattening of a cut slope already begun when rock is encountered to ensure the cut has a pleasing appearance. Use the presplitting technique to reduce overbreakage and to establish a free surface or shear plane in the rock along the cut periphery or proposed break lines.

- Presplit a periphery plane to the excavation depth before blasting within the plane.
- Conduct the presplitting process by drilling appropriately sized holes at intervals that will ensure a neat break, to the desired depth, along the plane of the proposed cut. Load and stem the holes with an appropriate light charge explosive, and detonate the explosives simultaneously.
- Allow an 18 in. (450 mm) offset in the slope to begin succeeding drilling operations when the depth of the cut is more than can be drilled from the top.

Create a relatively smooth shear plane as indicated in the Plans with localized irregularities that do not exceed 2 ft. (600 mm) behind or 1 ft. (300 mm) in front (roadway side) of the plane surface. Do not presplit slopes flatter than 1:1.

1. Overbreakage

Material that is excavated beyond or below the cross-section shown on the Plans or designated will be at the Contractor’s expense, except unavoidable overbreakage in solid rock. The allowable overbreakage is a maximum of 2 ft. (600 mm) below or outside the original template lines. Backfill to replace material removed below the limits specified at no expense to the Department.
2. Precautions

See Use of Explosives in Subsection 107.12.
3. Rock and Boulders

Handle rock and boulder excavation as follows:
- Excavate solid rock and boulders in the roadbed to at least 1 ft (300 mm) below the finished subgrade elevation and backfill the space to the correct grade with suitable subgrade material.
- Leave the side slopes of rock cuts with uniform faces whether or not the excavation is carried beyond the specified side slope.
- Remove loose rock on cut slopes immediately after blasting.
- Place stones, broken rock, and boulders found within the construction limits and not required for other construction, into embankment slopes when possible.
4. Ensure that sloped surfaces conform to the typical section shown on the Plans or to natural cleavage planes compatible with the typical section. Leave sloped surfaces safe and natural looking.

E. Unsuitable Material Excavation

The Engineer may require unsuitable material be removed from its location.

1. Remove material and backfill with properly compacted approved material.
2. Undercut material to the depth shown on the Plans or established by the Engineer in cut areas where the material is not suitable for subgrades or shoulders. Backfill the area with suitable material.
3. Excavate unsuitable material in roadway cuts and dispose of the material as directed by the Engineer.



---


# Section 205 — Roadway Excavation

The Department will not designate the unsuitable material excavation as a separate Pay Item unless specifically designated on the Plans, but will pay for it as “Roadway Excavation—Unclassified.”

# F. Obliteration of Old Roads

Obliterate old roads or other areas by completing the following work as directed by the Engineer:

- Obliterate discontinued roads or other areas inside or outside the Project construction limits.
- Grade, scarify, plow, and harrow obliterated areas.

The Department will pay for excavation (other than that necessary for finishing and dressing) as “roadway excavation—unclassified.” Follow this procedure to obliterate the road:

1. Fill old ditches and grade the roadway after the old road is no longer needed for traffic. Restore the original contour of the ground and produce a surface of naturally rounded slopes.
2. Use borrow required for the new roadway from fills in the old road (where feasible).
3. Place surplus and waste material from the new roadway in cuts in the old road (where feasible).
4. Break down and remove or bury old structures not required to maintain drainage flow. Remove and store material with salvage value, or use it in the new construction.
5. Scarify, harrow, and smooth the old surface. Re-grass disturbed areas or establish a vegetative cover according to Section 160 or Section 700 as applicable.

# G. Surcharge Removal

Remove and properly dispose of materials placed as surcharge for consolidation or other purposes.

1. Waste the material removed or use it for other purposes as specified on the Plans or in the Special Provisions.
2. Provide other areas for disposal if adequate areas are not available for disposing of excess surcharge within the Right-of-Way.

# H. Use of Select Materials

Conserve and use excavated materials suitable for subgrade, shoulder construction, plant topsoil, blanket for fill slopes, or other purposes as directed by the Engineer according to Subsection 104.06.

1. Reserve suitable material by either leaving it in its original position or stockpiling it as directed by the Engineer.
2. Haul select materials directly from the excavation area to the final placement area whenever possible. Do not stockpile materials unless specifically directed.

The Department will again pay for “roadway excavation—unclassified,” which includes necessary hauling and placement, when the material is removed from the stockpile.

# I. Final Finishing of Roadway

After excavation has been completed use the following procedure to finish the roadway:

1. Shape the surface of the roadbed and slopes to reasonably true grade alignment and cross-section shown on the Plans or established by the Engineer. Finish according to Section 209.
2. Leave cut slope surfaces in rock reasonably uniform and remove loose overhanging rock.
3. Open all ditches, drains, and culverts constructed to effectively drain the roadway.

The Department will make no separate payment for finishing done under this Section. Include the work in the cost of the roadway excavation.

Maintain the excavated areas until final acceptance of the Project.

# Section 205 — Roadway Excavation

# 205.4 Measurement

Original ground surface measurements will be obtained using conventional methods, photogrammetric means, or a combination of these methods. The Engineer will determine the method(s) and time when the measurements are to be taken for each Project.

The volume of Roadway Excavation-Unclassified, authorized and accepted by the Engineer, will be computed by the method of average end areas, or other acceptable means, using the original ground surface, the final ground surface, cross-section, or approved templates.

The final ground surface will be obtained from conventional field measurements, as-built templates, photogrammetric means, or a combination of these methods. The Engineer will determine the method(s) to be used on each Project.

The measurement will include:

- Overbreakage and slides in roadway excavation, unless they are caused by Contractor negligence
- Authorized excavation of rock or unsuitable material below template grade
- Material re-excavated from stockpiles and used in construction as directed by the Engineer
- Surcharge removal

Excavation outside of staked lines and slopes will never be measured for payment unless ordered or approved by the Engineer.

Ditch excavation will be measured as specified in paragraph one, above.

Retaining wall construction will be measured to the back and bottom of the select material backfill or footing as the Engineer determines. Any exception outside these lines by the Grading Contractor to provide stable slopes and positive drainage will not be measured and will be considered incidental to the work.

Filling or plugging abandoned wells will not be measured for payment but all costs shall be included in the price bid for Roadway Excavation when Item 205 is shown as a pay item. Otherwise all costs shall be included in the overall contract bid price.

Removing paving, aggregates, and ballasts will be measured and included in the computations for roadway excavation when Section 205 is shown as a pay item (unless those items are shown in the Plans as a separate pay item).

# 205.4.01 Limits

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 205.5 Payment

Removing paving, aggregates, and ballast will be paid for at the Contract Price bid per cubic yard (meter) when Item 205 is shown as a Pay Item, unless the items are shown in the Plans as a separate Pay Item.

The Department will withhold a percentage of the progress payments for the estimated quantity of earthwork (not to exceed 5 percent) until final dressing, subgrade construction, and satisfactory disposal of unsuitable or surplus materials is completed. This percentage withheld shall be in addition to that specified in Subsection 109.07.

The Contract Price per cubic yard (meter) for “roadway excavation—unclassified” will be paid for quantities of excavation measured according to Subsection 205.4. Payment is full compensation for:

- Excavating, hauling, placing, and compacting excavated material.
- Removing, loading, hauling, stockpiling as designated, and sawing pavement when payment is included under Item 205.
- Pre-splitting rock, disposing of unsuitable or surplus materials, excavating, shaping, disposing of unsatisfactory excavated materials, maintaining ditches (except channel excavation specified in Section 204), constructing subgrades and shoulders, and finishing, dressing, and maintaining the work until Final Acceptance.

Payment will be made under:

(1 m), the Contractor will be compensated for the extra depth excavated below the 3 ft. (1 m) limit according to Subsection 104.04 and Subsection 109.05. Calculate the width of extra depth excavation using the diameter of the pipe or the width of the footing plus 2 ft. (600 mm). The length of extra depth excavation is equal to the length of that portion of the structure that is lowered more than 3 ft. (1 m) below Plan elevation.

Section 207 — Excavation and Backfill for Minor Structures

# C. Backfill Materials Types I, II, III, and Graded Aggregate Materials

# 1. Types I and II

These materials (in place and accepted) are measured in cubic yards (meters) compacted. Lateral measurements are confined to an area bounded by vertical planes lying not more than 1 ft. (300 mm) outside of and parallel to the limits of the structure. Length and depth measurements are confined to the dimensions of compacted material in place as specified by the Engineer. Materials placed outside the above limitations are not measured for payment.

# 2. Type III

The Department measures Type III material (complete, in place, and accepted) in cubic yards (meters). Lateral measurements of Type III material are confined to an area bounded by vertical planes lying directly above the outside walls of the structure. Longitudinal measurements are confined to the length of treatment installed as specified. Measurements of depth are the dimensions shown on the plans or as directed.

# 3. Graded Aggregate Materials for Use with Thermoplastic Pipe

These materials (in place and accepted) are not measured separately for payment. Standard 1030P specifies the minimum cubic feet of graded aggregate required per linear foot of installation for thermoplastic pipe diameters. This value shall be multiplied by the length of the pipe installation to determine the theoretical amount of graded aggregate, in cubic feet, necessary to construct a proper structural envelope around the pipe placed.

The theoretical total obtained above shall then be multiplied by the following formula:

- The dry density, in pounds per cubic foot, of graded aggregate material multiplied by .000475. Use QPL-2 to determine the dry density applicable to the source of the material.

The above computations shall serve to quantify a minimum tonnage of graded aggregate material associated with thermoplastic pipe installations that require QPL approved source documentation. Width and depth excavations for thermoplastic pipe installation exceeding the dimensions provided on Standard 1030P by more than ten percent shall be multiplied by the pipe installation length and the above bulleted formula to compute additional required tonnage.

# D. Normal Backfill

This Item is not measured separately but is included in the measurement of the Items of excavation from which normal backfill materials are obtained.

# 207.4.01 Limits

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 207.5 Payment

# A. Excavation for Minor Structures

This Item will not be paid for separately except as provided in Subsection 207.4.B.

# B. Sheeting and Bracing

# 208.3.05 Construction

# A. Benching Excavation for Embankment

This work includes excavating material forming benches in the existing ground beneath proposed embankments. Form benches to increase the bond between the existing ground and the proposed embankment. This work is required where embankments are placed on hillsides or against existing embankments, which will be indicated on the plans. Construct the benches approximately 12 ft. (3.7 m) wide unless otherwise shown on the plans. Use material removed in the excavation in the embankments. The Department will make no additional payment for this work.

# B. Embankments

Follow these requirements when constructing embankments:

1. # Preparation for Embankments

Before starting embankment construction, clear and grub the embankment area according to Section 201 and install Drainage Structures according to Section 550.

1. # a. Depressions and Undercut Areas

Fill depressions below the ground surface and undercut areas with suitable material. Remove unsuitable or unstable material and compact according to Subsection 208.3.05.B.1.c before beginning embankment construction.
2. # b. Scarification and Other Preparation

Plow and scarify the entire area upon which the embankment is to be placed (except inundated areas) at least 6 in. (150 mm) deep. Before placing the embankment, recompact loosened soil to the approximate density of the underlying soil. Cut benches as specified in Subsection 208.3.05.A.
3. # c. Compaction Under Shallow Fills

When the depth of fill and surfacing is 3 ft. (1 m) or less, compact the original ground compact at least 1 ft. (300 mm) deep to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density as determined from representative samples of the compacted material using, GDT 7, GDT 24a, GDT 24b, or GDT 67 whichever applies. The in-place density of the compacted fill will be determined according to GDT 20, GDT 21, or GDT 59, whichever applies.



---


# Section 208 — Embankments

# d. Embankments Over Existing Roads, Parking Areas, and Floors

Thoroughly plow or scarify all portions of existing unpaved roads and flexible pavements. Destroy cleavage planes before placing the embankment.

1. Remove the old pavement with rigid surfaces if the new embankment is not more than 3 ft. (1 m) high.
2. Break remaining rigid pavements that are within 10 ft. (3 m) of the finished grade so that no section larger than 10 ft.² (1 m²) remains intact.

# 2. Embankment Formation

Use the following requirements when constructing the embankment formation:

# a. Layer Construction

Except as noted in Subsection 208.3.05.B.2.d, construct the embankments in parallel layers. Deposit the material and spread in horizontal layers not more than 8 in. (200 mm) thick, loose measurement, for the full width of the cross-section. Use motor graders, bulldozers, or other approved equipment to keep layers uniform. Compact the layers using a sheepsfoot roller. The Engineer may permit the use of vibratory rollers whenever the embankment soils consist of Class IA1, IA2, or IA3 materials.

# b. Moisture Content

Compact each layer within the range of optimum moisture content to achieve the compaction specified below. Do not construct successive layers on previous layers that exhibit excessive pumping under construction equipment regardless of compaction. Dry material if it contains too much moisture. Ensure the moisture content is sufficient for stability and compaction. Add water if the material is too dry and uniformly mix it with the soil for stability and compaction. The Department will not measure water added to the material under this requirement for payment. It is considered incidental to the satisfactory completion of the work.

# c. Degree of Compaction

Compact the embankment at bridge structures to at least 100 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density. Compact for the full depth of the embankment, beginning at the toe of the slope and extending 100 ft. (30 m) from the end of the bridge. Compact embankment other than at bridge structures to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density to within 1 ft. (300 mm) of the top of the embankment. Compact the top 1 ft. (300 mm) of the embankment to at least 100 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density. If grading and paving are let in separate contracts, the paving Contractor shall recompact the top 6 in. (150 mm) to at least 100 percent of the maximum laboratory density. The maximum laboratory dry density will be determined from representative samples of the compacted material using GDT 7, GDT 24a, GDT 24b, or GDT 67, whichever applies. The in-place density of the compacted fill will be determined according to GDT 20, GDT 21, or GDT 59, whichever is applicable.

# d. Special Conditions

Follow these special requirements:

1. Build layers as parallel as possible. In certain cases, the Engineer may permit steeper slopes at ends of the embankments.
2. In swamp or inundated areas that will not support the equipment, build the lower part of the fill by dumping successive loads in layers no thicker than necessary to support the hauling equipment.
3. Build and compact the remainder of fills in layers as specified above.

Section 208 — Embankments

e. Embankments at Structures

Use Class I or II material when constructing embankments over and around pipes, culverts, arches, and bridges according to Subsection 810.2.01.A.1. Class IIIC1 material may be used in Districts 1, 6, and 7.

1. Compact the material as specified in Subsection 208.3.05.B.2.c.
2. Place the specified material on both sides of bridge structures for a distance of at least 10 ft. (3 m).

NOTE: Do not place rock larger than 4 in. (100 mm) diameter within 2 ft. (600 mm) of any drainage structure.

Before any traffic is allowed over any structure, provide a sufficient depth of material over and around the structure to protect it from damage or displacement.

f. Method of Handling Classes of Soils

Handle the different classes of soils using the following methods:

1. Class IIB3 and Better Soils
Distribute and compact these soils in 8 in. (200 mm) uniform layers over the entire width of the embankment. Use these soils (when available in sufficient quantities) in the top 1 ft. (300 mm) of the roadbed. Reserve these soils for this purpose when directed by the Engineer.
2. Class IIB4 Soils
Distribute and compact these soils in 8 in. (200 mm) layers over the entire width of the embankment. Class IIB4 soils may be used in the top 12 in. (300 mm) of subgrade in Districts 1, 6, and 7. Class IIB4 soils may be used in the top 12 in. (300 mm) of subgrade in Districts 2, 3, 4, and 5 with a stabilizing agent if approved by the Office of Materials and Testing, Geotechnical Environmental Pavement Bureau. If Class IIB3 or better soils are available in borrow pits, use these soils in the top 12 in. (300 mm) of subgrade.
3. Class IIIC1 Soils
Class IIIC1 soils excavated per Section 204, 205 or 207, which excludes Section 206 (Borrow), may be used in Districts 1, 6, and 7 in embankments and within the top 12 in. (300 mm) of subgrade if approved by the Office of Materials and Testing, Geotechnical Environmental Pavement Bureau. If Class IIB4 or better soils are available in borrow pits, use these soils in the top 12 in. (300 mm) of subgrade.
4. Class IIIC2 and IIIC3 Soils
Class IIIC2 and IIIC3 soils excavated per Section 204, 205 or 207, which excludes Section 206 (Borrow) may be used in Districts 1, 6, and 7 in embankments, except within 5 ft. (1.5 m) of the bottom of subgrade directly beneath the pavement, if approved by the Office of Materials and Testing, Geotechnical Environmental Pavement Bureau.
5. Class IIIC4 Soils
Class IIIC4 chert clay soils in District 6 with less than 55 percent passing the No. 10 (2 mm) sieve may be used in embankments and subgrade. All other Class IIIC4 soils may not be used.
6. Class IV Soils
Do not use these soils in embankments. Waste these soils or (when designated in the Plans or directed by the Engineer) stockpile them and use them for blanketing fill slopes.
7. Class V Soils
Place these soils in the same manner as Class IIB4 soils. Pulverize large particles to obtain the proper compaction.

213

# Section 208 — Embankments

# 8) Class VI Rock

Place rock in uniform layers not over 3 ft. (1 m) thick and distribute it over the embankments to avoid pockets. Fill voids with finer material.

Do not place rock larger than 6 in. (150 mm) in diameter within 3 ft. (1 m) of the finished surface of the embankment.

Do not place rock larger than 6 in. (150 mm) in diameter within 2 ft. (600 mm) of the outer limits of proposed posts or utility poles.

Do not place rock at bridge end bents within 10 ft. (3 m) of pile locations.

# 9) All Classes

Place mixtures of the above classes together with random material such as rock, gravel, sand, cinders, slag, and broken-up pavement so that coarse particles are dumped near the outer slopes and finer particles near the center of the roadway.

Produce a gradual transition from the center to the outside. If material is too large to place in 8 in. (200 mm) layers, treat it as rock or break it down and place it in 8 in. (200 mm) layers.

# 3. Embankment Consolidation at Bridge Ends

When consolidating embankments at bridge ends, use the following specifications:

1. When a waiting period is required in the plans or by Special Provision, place end fills at bridges in time for consolidation readings to indicate that both the fill and the natural ground have reached the desired degree of stability.
2. Delay constructing bridge portions during the period of consolidation as shown on the plans or as required by a Special Provision. The plans or the Special Provisions will indicate the estimated time required to reach consolidation. The Engineer may extend or shorten this waiting period based on settlement readings taken on points placed in the fills. The longer or shorter waiting period will not constitute a valid claim for additional compensation.
3. Follow these specifications when extending a waiting period:
1. Extending an estimated waiting period may lead to increasing the Contract time. If the Contract is on a calendar day or completion date basis, the Department may increase the calendar days equal to the maximum number of calendar days involved in the extension.
2. When a time extension causes additional delay due to seasonal changes, the Engineer may recompute the time extension on an available day basis. When the Contract is on an available day basis, the time increase will be equal to the greatest number of available days involved in the extension.
3. When time charges on separate Bridge Contracts are controlled by Special Provisions that set forth the availability of bridge sites, extending an estimated waiting period controls the availability of that bridge site only; time charges will be adjusted according to the Special Provision.
4. Construct the embankment at bridge ends full-depth to the subgrade template (except for the stage construction providing a bench for the end bent) unless otherwise stated in the Plans and compact thoroughly before driving a piling at bridge ends.
5. The minimum acceptable length of completed full-depth embankment is equal to the maximum width of fill between slope stakes at the end of the bridge. The Department will measure the minimum length of full-depth embankment along the roadway centerline away from the end-of-bridge Station.

# 208.4 Measurement

The following section details measurement for payment for the work described in this Section:

# A.

Except as provided herein, there will be no measurement for payment for the work covered by this Section.

# B.

The Department will compute the quantity of in-place embankment or rock embankment using the average end area method, or other acceptable methods, when embankment is in place and accepted.

The quantity will be calculated as the neat volume, above the original ground surface, between the template line shown on the plans or authorized changes by the Engineer, and the original ground surface. The original ground surface is determined by conventional field, photogrammetric, or other methods. The Department will not deduct for the volume of culverts and manholes.

In-place embankment necessary for the construction of temporary detours will not be measured for payment and is considered incidental to the completion of the work unless specifically stated otherwise on the plans.

Where work includes excavating of unstable materials below the ground line, the volume of embankment required for backfill below the ground line is calculated based on the neat line measurement for the cross-section shown on the plans or established by the Engineer by the average end area method or other acceptable methods.

Where permitted by the Engineer or required by the plans, material removed from the existing roadbed, special ditches, berm ditches, or dry land borrow pits and used in making embankment will be paid for as in-place embankment regardless of the method of excavation.

If a subsequent Contract provides for base construction, eliminate mixing and compact the in-place subgrade to 95 percent of the laboratory maximum dry density.
4. Ensure that the subgrade can firmly support construction equipment before placing subsequent layers of base and paving materials. The subgrade must support construction equipment without excessive movement regardless of compaction.
5. Rework unstable areas of subgrade to a moisture content that will provide stability and compaction. The Engineer may direct the Contractor to proof roll the subgrade with a loaded dump truck.
6. Compact the subgrade using a sheepsfoot roller. The Engineer may permit the use of vibratory rollers whenever the subgrade soils consist of Class IaA1, IA2, or IA3 materials.
7. Ensure that subgrade material used underneath soil-cement base meets the requirements of Subsection 301.3.03.A.

# B. Subgrade Stabilization

Construct a stabilized subgrade according to Plans or as directed:

1. Undercut and dispose of the amount of subgrade material that will be displaced with the aggregate or selected material according to the Engineer’s direction.
2. Leave material off the subgrade in fill sections requiring stabilization.
3. Place the amount of material specified in Subsection 209.2.B. on the subgrade as specified on the Plans or established by the Engineer.
4. Thoroughly incorporate the material into the existing subgrade to a depth of 6 in. (150 mm), or as indicated on the plans. Plow, disk, harrow, blade, and then mix with rotary tillers until the mixture is uniform and homogeneous throughout the depth to be stabilized.
5. Finish the stabilized subgrade to the plan line, grade, and cross-section. Compact it to 100 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density as defined in Subsection 209.3.06. Plant mixing is permitted as an alternative to the mixed-in-place method.
6. Eliminate the mixing and scarifying method before compaction in undercut areas where Type III Stabilizer Aggregates are specified, unless otherwise specified by the Engineer.

Section 209 — Subgrade Construction

C. Select Materials Subgrade

Place select materials as follows:

1. Place the subgrade with a uniform blanket of select material consisting of Class I or II soil or graded aggregate (according to Plan dimensions or as directed by the Engineer). Class IIIC1 soils may be used in Districts 1, 6, and 7 within the top 12 in. (300 mm) of subgrade if approved by the Office of Materials and Testing, Geotechnical Environmental Pavement Bureau. Do not use Class IIIC2, IIIC3, or IIIC4 soils within the top 12 in. (300 mm) of subgrade unless a stabilizing agent approved by the Engineer is added, or if approved by the Office of Materials and Testing, Geotechnical Environmental Pavement Bureau. Class IIIC4, chert clay soils in District 6 with less than 55 percent passing the No. 10 (2 mm) sieve may be used for subgrade.
2. Use the select material reserved from the grading or borrow operations. If material is not available through this source, obtain it from other sources.
3. Finish and compact the material according to Subsection 209.3.05.A.

D. Shoulder Stabilization

Stabilize the shoulder as follows:

1. Spread the stabilizer aggregate at the rate and to the dimensions indicated on the Plans.
2. Mix the aggregate with the in-place shoulder material thoroughly to the Plan depth.
3. Compact the area thoroughly and finish it to Plan dimensions.
4. Prime the stabilized area according to Section 412 when a paving course is required on the shoulders.

E. Finishing Subgrade

When finishing subgrade use the following procedure:

1. Leave the underlying subgrade in cuts and fills low enough to accommodate the additional material when the work requires either subgrade stabilization, select material subgrade, or stabilization for shoulders.
2. Test short sections in curb and gutter areas might be necessary to obtain the proper elevation.
3. Blade the surface of the completed subgrade to a smooth and uniform texture.

# 209.3.06 Quality Acceptance

The Department will test representative samples of compacted material to determine the laboratory maximum dry density using GDT 7, GDT 24a, or GDT 67 as applicable.

The Department will determine in-place density of the compacted subgrade according to GDT 20, GDT 21, or GDT 59, as applicable.

Ensure that the centerline profile conforms to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of ±0.5 in (±13 mm). The acceptable tolerance under a template conforming to the designated cross section shall be ±0.25 in. (±6 mm).

Have the Department test the maximum dry density using methods according to Subsection 209.3.05.A. When base construction is not in the same Contract, the tolerances may be 1 in. (25 mm), 0.5 in. (13 mm), and 95 percent respectively.

- Do not jet back fills.
- Place backfill material to apply only balanced horizontal loads to a newly placed structure or portion of structure. Do not backfill portions of structures that do not have backfill on all sides until the concrete has reached the required strength (as determined by the Engineer) to withstand the earth pressures.
2. Intermediate Bents and Piers
Compact backfill for intermediate bents and piers to the approximate density of the surrounding soil.

- Begin and complete backfilling around substructures not supported by piling the next workday after placing the lift, if possible. Backfill at least within three calendar days after placement.
- Backfill footings before beginning form work on the columns.
- Begin backfilling around pile-supported footings and columns after removing forms. Complete as soon as possible but within five calendar days after placing concrete.
3. End Bents and Abutments
Compact backfill for end bents and abutments (including their wingwalls) to the density shown on the Standard Plans or Special Plans.

- Begin and complete the work no later than five calendar days after placing concrete, unless other time limits are indicated on the Plans. If other time limits are indicated, this work may be second stage construction, or second stage backfill construction.
- Steep slopes behind abutments, unless otherwise shown, and take precautions to prevent the backfill from wedging against the abutment.
- Provide drainage behind abutments and their wingwalls as shown on the plans.
- Place backfill for abutment footings and portions of walls having fill on both sides of the wall according to Subsection 211.3.05.D.4.
4. Backfill Material
Backfill around intermediate bents and piers with material removed from the excavation, unless the material is unsatisfactory to the Engineer.

- Ensure that material for end bents and abutments meets the requirements shown on the Standard Plans or Special Plans. When suitable material is not available within the immediate vicinity of the bridge within the right-of-way, locate a source acceptable to the Engineer and haul the material to the site.
- Obtain and place backfill material necessary for end bent and abutment construction, including special backfill material used in constructing mechanically stabilized earth wall abutments.
- Ensure that material located and hauled to the bridge site meets the requirements of Class I, Class II, or as shown in Subsection 810.2.01.A.1, unless otherwise noted. Class IIIC1 material may be used in Districts 6 and 7.
- Ensure that porous backfill (when specified) consists of coarse aggregate size No. 57 as specified in Subsection 800.2.01, or crushed stone drainage material as specified in Subsection 806.2.02.A.

Section 225 — Soil-Lime Construction

# D. Apply Lime

# 1. General

- Apply lime according to the rate specified by the Engineer.
- Apply lime uniformly so that the applied does not vary more than +/- 10 percent of the quantity specified for each section.
- Apply lime only to areas that can be mixed in one day.
- Do not mix lime with frozen soils or with soils containing frost. Perform lime stabilization only when the air temperature is above 45 °F (7 °C) and only between April 1 and October 15, unless directed otherwise by the Engineer.
- Distribute lime at the specified rate by making repeated passes over a section until the required amount has been spread.
- After each pass, incorporate the material into the soil with mixing equipment. If necessary, add more water to the mix to accelerate mellowing.

# 2. Protect and Ensure Safety

- Provide the necessary equipment and take the necessary precautions to protect operations personnel from the hazards of lime dust or slurry.
- Prevent damage, discomfort, or inconvenience to the public or to private property while preparing and distributing lime.

# 3. Methods

Spread lime on scarified areas at the specified rate. Distribute the material uniformly to avoid excessive loss. Choose one of the following three methods to apply lime:

# a. Dry Application with Quicklime

Adjust the design application rate that was based on using hydrated lime, to reflect the properties of quicklime. Use the following formula to determine the application rate for quicklime:

ARQ = ARH / (1.32 * P)

where;

- ARQ = Application Rate for Quicklime
- ARH = Design Application Rate Based on Hydrated Lime
- 1.32 = Ratio of molecular weights for hydrated lime (74) and quicklime (56)
- P = Certified Percent Purity of The Quicklime

Do not apply quicklime if the Engineer determines that wind conditions could make blowing lime hazardous to traffic, workers, or adjacent property. Minimize lime pockets by applying lime to shaped and rolled areas that are relatively smooth. Spread uniformly at the specified rate using a mechanical spreader approved by the Engineer.

# b. Slurry Made with Hydrated Lime

Create a lime slurry by mixing 30 percent dry lime solids, by weight, with 70 percent water. Mix slurry in agitating equipment and continue to agitate until arriving at the roadbed. Spread slurry on the scarified area with distributing equipment.

# c. Slurry Made by Slaking Quicklime

Create a lime slurry by slaking quicklime using special equipment at or near the Project site. Obtain the Engineer’s approval for all equipment and procedures before work begins.



---

Section 225 — Soil-Lime Construction

E.  Mix Lime

1. General
Maintain the moisture content of the material at its specified optimum or not more than 5 percent over the optimum, at all times. Add water during mixing if necessary, even if the material has the optimum moisture content to sustain the chemical reaction between lime and water. Mix the material the same as for “Dry Application” or “Slurry Application” unless indicated otherwise.

1. Immediately after applying the lime:
1. Mix to the required depth and width.
2. If the depth to be treated, as shown on the Plans, is more than 12 in. (300 mm) compacted, treat in approximately equal layers of not more than 12 in. (300 mm) deep.
3. When multi-layer construction is required, blade the upper layers of the compacted soil in windrows outside the area to be treated until the lower layer is mixed, compacted, and approved by the Engineer.
4. Blade each successive layer back into place, shape and treat it with lime, mix, compact and shape to typical section. Include the cost of this manipulation in the bid price.
2. Control scarifying and mixing to provide uniform depth. Make the crown of the undisturbed soil underneath conform as closely as possible to the crown of the finished course.
3. Until the lime is incorporated or mixed, allow only spreading, watering, or mixing equipment to drive over the section being processed.
4. Determine bulking factors from the dry weight of laboratory-tested raw and lime treated soils. Furnish a finished course of lime treated material that conforms to the specified thickness and surface requirements in the plans.
2. Mix Lime (Initial)
1. Class A or Class B Lime Treatment
1. Incorporate lime and water with rotary mixers until uniform. The mixture must pass through a 2 in. (50 mm) sieve.
2. Add the amount of water necessary to produce a moisture content of no less than 0 percent below the mixture’s optimum moisture content or no more than 5 percent above optimum moisture content. See GDT 19.
3. After mixing is complete, reshape the treated course to the approximate line, grade, and typical section.
4. Seal with a light, pneumatic-tired roller and other approved equipment, as necessary.
5. Mellow for a minimum of 12 hours and a maximum of 72 hours.
2. Class C Lime Treatment
1. Incorporate lime and water with rotary mixers until uniform. Continue to mix and add water until obtaining a homogeneous mixture of soil, lime, and water that is satisfactory to the Engineer.
2. After mixing and applying water, ensure that 100 percent of the material by dry weight passes a 1.0 in. (25 mm) sieve and 60 percent by dry weight passes a No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve.



---

Section 225 — Soil-Lime Construction

3. Mix and Pulverize Lime (Final)

The following applies to Class A and Class B lime treatments only.

- a. After the required mellowing period, scarify the layer.
- b. After a Class A treatment, add the second application of lime.
- c. Remix the layer as prescribed in the initial mixing operations, adding water as necessary.
- d. Continue mixing until 100 percent of the material by dry weight, exclusive of gravel and stone, passes a 1.0 in. (25 mm) sieve and 60 percent passes a No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve.
- e. Ensure that the percent of moisture is at or above the laboratory specified optimum moisture.
- f. If mixing cannot be completed in one day, seal the surface of the layer with a rubber-tired roller. Continue the process the next day, weather permitting.

F. Compact Lime Layer

Compact the material according to the following requirements and to Subsection 225.3.06.B, Finishing Requirements for finishing.

1. Class A and B Lime Treatments
- Compact the mixture within 4 hours after completing the final mixing. Maintain the material at a moisture content within ±2 percent of optimum.
2. Class C Lime Treatment
- Compact the mixture immediately after completing the first and only mixing. Maintain the material at a moisture content within ±2 percent of optimum.
3. Class A, B, and C Treatments
- a. Complete compaction operations during one working day.
- b. Keep the moisture content of the material uniform when compacting. Maintain the material at optimum moisture content or up to two percent over the optimum content.
- c. Compact uniformly and continuously, beginning at the bottom. Use sheepsfoot-type rollers. Continue until the entire depth of the mixture is compacted to the required density specified in Subsection 225.3.06.A.
- d. Immediately correct depressions or soft spots that develop in the compacted areas with the following methods:
1. Scarify the area.
2. Add lime when required.
3. Remove the material when required.
4. Reshape and compact.
- e. Stop compaction and remove the sheepsfoot-type roller when a layer of loose soil not exceeding 1 in. (25 mm) remains.
- f. In addition to the requirements specified for density, compact the full depth of the mixture to the extent necessary for it to remain stable under construction equipment.

Section 225 — Soil-Lime Construction

# G. Cure Lime (Final)

# 1. General

- After the lime-treated soil has been finished as specified in Subsection 225.3.06.B, keep it moist for 7 days.
- Lime stabilized subgrade or embankment may be cured by applying water to maintain the course moist during curing.
- To protect a lime-stabilized base, subbase, or shoulder course, apply bituminous prime material (see Subsection 225.2.D) according to Section 412.
- Apply the prime as soon as possible, but not later than 24 hours after completing the finishing operations, unless delayed by wet weather. If delayed, apply prime as soon as the surface is sufficiently dry.
- Ensure the lime-treated soil surface is free of all loose and extraneous material and that it contains sufficient moisture to prevent excessive penetration of the bituminous material.
- If directed by the Engineer, sweep the lime-treated soil clean of loose material before applying the prime.

# 2. Apply the Prime

- Apply the bituminous material uniformly to the surface of the lime-treated soil at the rate of 0.15 to 0.30 gal/yd² (0.70 to 1.4 L/m²).
- Properly maintain the material during the entire curing period so that all of the lime-treated soil will be covered effectively during this period.
- Complete curing prior to placing subsequent layers of material.

# 3. Protect Lime Layer

- If necessary, open completed sections of the lime-treated soil to lightweight local traffic. Make sure the curing is not impaired and that the treated sections have hardened sufficiently to prevent marring or distorting the surface.
- Use construction equipment on the lime-treated soil only to discharge material into the spreader during base or paving operations or except as may be permitted for embankment construction.

# 225.3.06 Quality Acceptance

# A. Density Requirements

After shaping the mixture to line, grade, and cross-section specifications, roll the course until uniformly compacted as determined by GDT 19. Use the percentages of maximum dry density in the following table. Determine the in-place density according to GDT 20, GDT 21, or GDT 59, as applicable.

# 225.4 Measurement

# A. Soil‐Lime Material

If it is necessary to add other material to the roadbed, or to build the base or subbase entirely with new material, soil-lime material is measured by loose volume cubic yard (meter), as specified in Section 109.

# B. Soil‐Lime Treated Roadbed, Subbase, and Base Course

If payment is specified by the square yard (meter), soil-lime treated roadbed, subbase, and base course are measured with the methods used for soil-cement specified in Section 301.

# C. Lime

- Lime is measured by the ton (megagram).
- If quicklime (CaO) is slaked on the job in an approved mixing tank to produce a lime slurry, the pay quantity for lime is measured in ton (megagram) of hydrated lime. The pay quantity is calculated using the certified lime purity for each truckload as follows:
Total Weight of Hydrated Lime Produced, ton (Mg) = (A x B x 1.32) + A (C)

Where:

- A = actual quicklime delivered
- B = certified % purity
- C = % inert material
- 1.32 = ratio of molecular weights for hydrated lime (74) and pure quicklime (56)
- If quicklime is spread on the roadbed in a dry application, it is measured by the ton (megagram) based on invoice weight.
- The formula for converting quicklime to hydrated lime does not apply for dry applications.

# D. Prime

Bituminous prime is not measured for separate payment. Application will be according to Section 412.

Section 300 — General Specifications for Base and Subbase Courses

# 300.2 Materials

Find the specifications for materials to be used and the references for them under the appropriate section for each base and subbase type construction. Ensure that each material meets the requirements for the type specified. Incorporate only materials that meet the Engineer’s approval.

Admixtures meeting the requirements of Subsection 831.2.03 and approved for use in stabilized bases or subbases shall be governed by the requirements as outlined in Laboratory Standard Operating Procedure No. 5, Quality Control of Portland Cement and Blended Hydraulic Cements and Quality Control of Fly Ash and Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag.

# A. Selecting Local Materials at the Source

The Engineer has the authority to classify materials at the source and require the materials to be excavated in the proper sequence so that each kind will reach its destination at the best location for that material in the finished work. The Engineer has the authority to reject any unsuitable materials.

# B. Sources of Local Materials Outside the Right-of-Way

Follow the provisions of Subsection 106.10, Local Material Sources to obtain materials from local sources outside the right-of-way.

# 300.2.01 Delivery, Storage, and Handling

# A. Storing at Central Mix Plants

Store material at a plant site with enough space for separate stockpiles, bins, or stalls for each size of aggregate. Keep aggregates separated until delivery to the plant feeders for proportioning. Keep the storage yard neat and the stockpiles, bins, and stalls accessible for obtaining samples.

# 300.3 Construction Requirements

# 300.3.01 Personnel

Supply all personnel and equipment necessary for obtaining samples from base plants and delivering them to the plant laboratory.

# 300.3.02 Equipment

Ensure that all equipment for constructing base and subbase courses is of an approved design and in satisfactory condition before construction begins. The equipment required for each type of base or subbase will be determined according to the construction method used.

# A. Central Mix Plants

The central mixing plant will not be approved for proportioning, batching, or mixing unless a field laboratory meeting the requirements of Section 152 is available for the exclusive use of the Engineer or Inspector. Design, coordinate, and operate plants so that the mixture is produced within the specified tolerances. The requirements are as follows.

# 1. Scales

Before any mixture is delivered to the project, check all scales with standard weights for accuracy and for agreement with each other. If weight proportioning is used, provide accurate scales so all ingredients of the mixture can be weighed separately. Use scales that are accurate to within 0.5 percent of the measured load. Support scales with rigid supports so that vibration from the plant does not interfere with accurate readings.



---

Section 300 — General Specifications for Base and Subbase Courses

1. Weight Box and Hopper Scales

- Use springless dial scales of a standard make and design for weight boxes and hopper. Inspect and seal scales when the Engineer determines it necessary to assure accuracy. Ensure that at least ten 50 lb. (25 kg) weights are available for testing the scales.

b. Motor Truck Scales

- With each plant, include a motor truck scale with a platform large enough to accommodate the entire length of any vehicle used. Ensure that the scale is certified according to Section 109 and is large enough to weigh the largest anticipated load. Do not measure weights greater than the rated capacity of the scales.
- Ensure that the weights of the aggregate batches in the truck before delivery to the project are within two percent of the sum of the weights of the batch ingredients.
- Complete Forms OMR-TM-141 (Daily Truck Weights) and Form 474 (Tally Sheet) for each day’s production and submit them to the Engineer.

2. Mixer

- Equip each central mix plant with an approved mixer.
- If Portland cement is required, begin mixing immediately after the cement is added to the coarse aggregate and soil mortar. Continue mixing until a homogeneous and uniform mixture is produced.
- If the equipment does not produce a homogeneous and uniform mixture that meets these specifications, the Engineer will require the Contractor to make the changes necessary to accomplish this result.
- Any adjustments made to the charge in a batch mixer or the rate of feed to a continuous mixer must ensure a complete mix of all of the material.
- Correct dead areas in the mixer where the material does not move or is not sufficiently agitated, by reducing the volume of material or by making other adjustments.

3. Mixture Proportioning

- Add Portland cement, bituminous materials, aggregates, or other ingredients in such a manner that they are uniformly distributed throughout the mixture during the mixing operation.

4. Water Proportioning

- In all plants, proportion water by weight. Provide a means for the Engineer to verify the amount of water per batch or the rate of flow for continuous mixing.
- Use spray bars to evenly distribute moisture throughout the mixture.

5. Sampling

- Use sampling equipment approved by the Engineer to obtain samples before combining them with other ingredients or introducing them into the mixer.
- Use sampling equipment to provide an accurate representation of the furnished material.

6. Additional Requirements for Continuous-Mixing Plants

- a. Feeder System



---

# Section 300 — General Specifications for Base and Subbase Courses

Use an electronic control package capable of tracking which accepts a signal from the belt-weighing device and signals to continuously vary the dry and liquid additive feeder speed and maintain the feed rate.

Proportion dry additives with a gravimetric (depleting weight) system meeting the following requirements:

- The dry additive gravimetric (depleting weight) system includes an isolation vessel supported by load cells independent of the fines silo.
- Use load cells in conjunction with an electronic scale package having remote digital display and the necessary controls. Continuously weigh the material being metered with a positive displacement feeder mounted on the discharge of the isolation vessel.

# b. Control System

Use a control package that has a plant interlock shutdown capability. Plants must be able to shut down if actual flow rates differ from desired flow rates excessively. If the flow rate deviates excessively, an alarm shall sound at any of the aggregate, dry additive, or liquid additive metering devices.

Provide a monitoring station to control the entire operation that shows continuous quantitative data on the production and proportioning of the mix ingredients.

# c. Portable Power Units

Equip plants that use portable electric power generators with a frequency meter (graduated and accurate to one hertz) and a voltmeter (graduated and accurate to two volts), installed in the power circuit.

# d. Mixer

Use a mixer equipped with enough paddles or blades to produce a uniform and homogeneous mixture. Replace paddle blades that show more than 25 percent wear in the face area. Use paddles that can be adjusted to angular positions on the shafts and that can be reversed to retard the flow of the mix. Keep the mixer level.

# e. Surge Hopper

Equip the mixer with a surge hopper. Use a surge hopper that automatically discharges the mixture when it reaches a predetermined level.

# 7. Additional Requirements For Batch-Mixing Plants

# a. Weigh Box or Hopper

Use weigh boxes and hoppers that are suspended on scales, large enough to hold a full batch without spilling or needing hand raking, and equipped with a device for accurately weighing each size of aggregate.

Provide a convenient and accurate means of obtaining samples of aggregates from each bin before the material enters the mixing chamber. Equip each bin compartment with a bin level indicator that automatically stops weighing when a bin is empty.

# b. Mixer

Include an approved, leak-proof batch mixer in the plant. Use a mixer fast enough or equipped with enough paddles or blades to produce a properly and uniformly mixed batch. Replace paddles and blades that show more than 25 percent wear in the face area.

# c. Weighing Cement

Weigh cement on scales separate from the aggregate batching scales. Ensure that all scales meet the requirements of Section 109.

# d. Proportioning Bituminous

Introduce bituminous material into the mixer through spray bars and weigh it on scales separate from the aggregate batching scales.

# e. Control of Mixing Time

Use a time-locking device that automatically limits mixing time. Do not mix materials less than 30 seconds.

---

# Section 300 — General Specifications for Base and Subbase Courses

# B. In-Place Mixers

For in-place mixing operations, use mixers that meet the following requirements:

# 1. Multiple Pass Mixers

Use approved rotary-type multiple pass mixers with sufficient tines that mix cement, soil or soil-aggregate, and water uniformly for the full depth of the course.

# 2. Traveling Plant Mixers

Use approved traveling mixing plants to pick up the aggregate, soil, or other materials from the windrow or roadway. Use plants equipped with a bottom shell or pan that pick up and mix the material while it is separated from the foundation material during at least 50 percent of the mixing cycle. Use plants that mix the material for the full depth of the section. Ensure that travelling plants move forward with successive increments the length and width of the roadbed so that the roadbed is compacted and finished in one operation. Ensure that none of the materials being mixed are lost or segregated. Use plants mounted on wheels or crawler tracks wide enough so that they will not rut or damage the mixed surface when loaded to capacity. Use plants with a pressurized metering device that introduces water during mixing. Ensure that devices for proportioning water and materials to be mixed accurately measures the specified amounts while the machine is in motion. For bituminous stabilization, use plants equipped with a metering device that accurately measures the bituminous material into the mixer within the tolerances specified in Section 302.3.05.B. Ensure that the meter indicator dial has a scale with divisions indicating gallons (liters). If mixing equipment does not produce a homogeneous and uniform mixture, make the changes necessary to produce this result, as required by the Engineer.

# C. Mechanical Cement Spreader

When the material is to be mixed in-place, use an approved mechanical cement spreader to uniformly and accurately spread the cement. Do not use pneumatic tubes to transfer the cement from the tanker to the material to be stabilized.

# D. Mixture Spreader

Use an approved mechanical spreader that meets the following requirements to uniformly spread the mixture:

- A height-adjustable strike-off plate to obtain the specified thickness of the finished base
- A self-propelled spreader with rollers to contact the truck tires and push the truck without skewing the spreader or truck
- A hopper large enough to prevent spilling or wasting the material

# E. Static Rollers

Use static rollers that meet the following requirements. Use self-propelled static rollers on cement stabilized base.

# 1. Trench Roller

In this context, “roller” describes a wheel made of a flat metal surface; “wheel” describes a rubber wheel of the automotive type. When base widening is specified, use at least one trench roller. Use a trench roller that has a guiding roller or wheel that operates in tandem with the compression roller on the area to be compacted or with the auxiliary wheel or roller. Ensure that the trench roller is equipped with an auxiliary wheel or roller, mounted on a height-adjustable axle. The contact surface of the auxiliary wheel or roller must be adjustable to at least 10 in. (250 mm) above and 2 in. (50 mm) below the rolling plane of the compression roller. If this adjustment is not sufficient to compact the subgrade to the Plan elevation, adjust the contact surface the necessary amount. If the steering roller or wheel operates in tandem with the auxiliary wheel or roller, it does not need to be height-adjustable.

---

# Section 300 — General Specifications for Base and Subbase Courses

Ensure that the auxiliary wheel or roller operates on the surface of the pavement adjacent to the area to be compacted, and at a distance from the edge of the pavement that no damage occurs. Keep the height adjustment of the auxiliary wheel or roller such that the compression roller will develop a smooth, compacted surface true to crown.

Use gas-propelled trench rollers equipped with reversing, smooth operating friction clutches. Ensure that friction clutches have smooth operating brakes of ample capacity. Use either hand-powered or power-operated steering devices.

The compression per inch (25 mm) width of compression roller shall not be less than 300 lbs. (545 kg) and not greater than 365 lbs. (660 kg). If necessary, use a hollow compression roller and secure the minimum weight with liquid ballast. The trench roller must compact a minimum width of at least 15 in. (375 mm).

Fit rollers with adjustable spring scrapers that can scrape in both directions.

# 2. Steel-Wheel Rollers

Use three-wheel or tandem steel-wheel rollers. Use self-propelled rollers equipped with cleaning devices to prevent material from adhering to the wheels.

For base or subbase materials, use 3-wheel rollers on base or subbase materials that have a minimum weight of 10 tons (9 Mg) and a minimum compression of 325 pounds per inch (580 kg/100 mm) of width for the rear wheels.

Use steel wheel tandem rollers with a minimum weight of 10 tons (9 Mg) and a minimum compression of 225 pounds per inch (400 kg/100 mm) of width for the rear drum.

# 3. Pneumatic-Tire Rollers

Use pneumatic-tire rollers with a minimum contact pressure of 50 psi (345 kPa) per wheel.

Equip rollers to uniformly distribute the load between all wheels.

Use multiple axle, multiple wheel rollers with wheels staggered on the axles and spaces between each wheel to provide uniform compaction for the full compacting width of roller.

Ensure that the air pressure of any tire does not vary more than 5 psi (35 kPa) from the established pressure.

Operate rollers between 3 mph (5 kph) and 8 mph (13 kph), unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.

# 4. Sheepsfoot Rollers

Use vibratory or static compaction sheepsfoot rollers of sufficient size and weight to obtain the desired compaction.

# F. Vibratory Rollers

Use an approved vibratory roller designed to activate the frequency of vibration and the roller movement separately. Ensure that the weight and amplitude of the roller can compact the surface to specifications with a minimum number of passes.

# G. Bituminous Sampling Valve

Use bituminous transfer pumps that include a valve for sampling bituminous materials.

# H. Fine Grading Machine

Specifications for the Fine Grading Machine are included in either a Special Provision or a Supplemental Specification in the proposal or in the current Supplemental Specification book.

Section 300 — General Specifications for Base and Subbase Courses

# 300.3.03 Preparation

# A. Alternate Methods

When alternate methods of construction are provided without restriction, the Contractor may select these alternate methods at will, provided the equipment and organization are suited to the method selected. Before starting construction, discuss the proposed method with the Engineer. The method selected must:

- Spread base or subbase material uniformly without damaging the subgrade, subbase, or the material being placed
- Mix the materials until they are homogeneous
- Use the specified water and cement or bitumen content
- Compact throughout the depth of the course to the density specified
- Complete the work within the specified time limits

Organize the work and equipment so that spreading, compacting, and finishing the base or subbase is a continuous operation. Do not exceed minimum or maximum time limits where the detailed Specifications require them, except in unusual cases where permitted by the Engineer.

# B. Preparing the Pit Site

Remove grass, weeds, roots, and other debris from local materials pits. Adhere to the requirements of Subsection 107.23, Environmental Considerations when performing this work. Include the cost in the prices bid for the pertinent Pay Items. This work is not considered as clearing and grubbing.

# C. Preparing the Subgrade

If the subgrade does not meet the requirements of Section 209 for surface, compaction, and stability, repair all defective portions until it meets the requirements of that Section. Remove unsuitable materials and replace with acceptable material, if necessary. Compact the subgrade as specified in Section 209.

Have enough prepared subgrade meeting the requirements of Section 209 for at least one day of base construction before beginning work.

# D. Preparing the Subbase

If a subbase is required, prepare it according to the requirements for surface and compaction. Ensure that it is stable enough to support the equipment that will place the base material without rutting or pumping. Repair all defective portions and replace any unsuitable material with acceptable material, if the subbase does not meet the requirements of the specifications.

# 300.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 300.3.05 Construction

# A. Draining and Leaving Materials Pits

Keep materials pits well drained while materials are being removed from them. After removing materials, leave pits in the condition required by Section 106 and Section 160.

# B. Mining and Mixing in a Pit

Mine all local materials pits within the pit boundaries and grid depths established by the Engineer. Mine all materials from top to bottom. Mix materials in the pit before hauling to the roadbed or plant. Place materials in windrows or stockpiles with a dragline or backhoe. Blend the gradation and moisture strata from each pit to a uniform mixture.

When a rim ditch is required and its depth exceeds the specified grid depth of soil-cement material, include only the material above the grid depth as base material. Use this material for the windrow or stockpile of material to be used for soil-cement base unless the Engineer determines that below-the-grid material is satisfactory.



---

Section 300 — General Specifications for Base and Subbase Courses

Only use ladder pans and scrapers for stockpiling and windrowing in pits that are less than 18 in (450 mm) deep. After the preliminary mixing, prevent the coarse materials from segregating from the fine materials with loading equipment that continues to blend the material.

# C. Placing Materials

1. Mixture Control
The Engineer will determine the proportions of the materials to be used in compounding the base or subbase. The Engineer will determine the analysis basis of the components. Change the mix, if required by the Engineer, to ensure that the finished base meets the requirements of these specifications.
2. Moisture Control
Control the moisture content according to the specified requirements for each type of base or subbase. Add water uniformly, allow it to evaporate or aerate, and roll the materials as often as necessary, to control the moisture content within the limits specified.
3. Number of Courses
Because the maximum thickness of base or subbase materials to be mixed or spread in one course varies with the equipment used, it is subject to the Engineer’s approval. Ensure that the thickness meets the requirements of Subsection 300.3.05.C.5, Compaction.
4. Widening Work
Ensure that widening work conforms to Section 150. When widening in traffic areas, excavate an area that can be completed in the same day. When widening pavement on which there is traffic on both sides, stagger operations to keep the widening trench open in one lane of traffic at a time.
5. Compaction
Compact the entire thickness of all bases and subbases to the specified maximum dry weight per cubic foot (meter), as determined by the method specified in the Section for each base or subbase. If any base or subbase is more than 6 in. (150 mm) thick, construct according to the following table for layer thickness:

| Material                           | Layer Thickness                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topsoil, Sand-Clay, or Chert       | Two equal layers, or one layer not to exceed 8 in. (200 mm) |
| Graded Aggregate                   | Two equal layers, or one layer not to exceed 8 in. (200 mm) |
| Cement Stabilized Graded Aggregate | Two equal layers, or one layer not to exceed 8 in. (200 mm) |
| Cement Stabilized Soil Aggregate   | Two equal layers, or one layer not to exceed 8 in. (200 mm) |
| Sand Bituminous                    | Two equal layers, or one layer not to exceed 8 in. (200 mm) |
| Soil-Cement                        | One layer not to exceed 8 in. (200 mm)                      |

# D. Meeting Surface Requirements

Produce a smooth, uniform surface that complies with these specifications. Rebuild any areas that do not meet the requirements or remove or add material to the area until the Engineer approves of the work.

Section 300 — General Specifications for Base and Subbase Courses

# 300.3.06 Quality Acceptance

# A. Monitoring Quality Control

Ensure that the mixture and the materials used meet the following quality controls:

- Before producing any mixture for the project, calibrate the electronic sensors, devices, or settings for proportioning all mixture ingredients by scale weight. Calibrate in the presence of the Engineer, the proportioning of every ingredient for all rates of production.
- Maintain a dated, written record of the most recent calibration. Post the calibration at the base plant and make the record available for the Engineer’s inspection at all times. Format records as graphs, tables, charts, or mechanically prepared data. If the material changes, the rate of production changes by more than +/- 20%, the plant is not producing base material for more than two weeks, or if a component affecting the ingredient proportions has been repaired, replaced, or adjusted, check and recalibrate the proportions.
- Verify the moisture of the mixture being produced. Perform checks on ingredient proportioning and verify truck weight as directed by the Engineer. Provide quality control personnel and all necessary equipment to perform and document moisture tests. Perform moisture tests at a frequency of at least one test per hour of base plant production.

# B. Repairing Defects

During construction: If materials that do not meet these specifications are placed on the roadway at any time during construction, remove and replace them with acceptable materials as a part of the Pay Item for the base or subbase being constructed.

# A. In‐Place Mixing

# 1. Soil

If additional soil is needed on the roadbed, place and spread the soil uniformly to the proper depth to obtain the specified thickness.

# 2. Pulverization

Pulverize the roadbed materials as follows:

- a. Loosen and pulverize roadbed materials to the width and depth to be stabilized without disturbing or damaging the underlying subgrade.
- b. Continue pulverizing until 100 percent of roadbed material passes through a 1-1/2 in. (37.5 mm) sieve, and until at least 80 percent of the soil, excluding any stone or gravel, passes through a No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve.
- c. Add water to assist pulverization if necessary.
- d. Remove all roots, sod, and rocks that exceed 3 in. (75 mm) in diameter.
- e. Remove all other harmful materials.

# 3. Moisture Adjustments

Immediately before spreading cement, adjust the moisture content of the in-place material so it will stabilize to within 100 to 120 percent of optimum moisture (amount of moisture in the mixture at maximum dry density).

# 4. Cement

Spread cement as follows:

- a. Uniformly spread the required amount of Portland cement with a cyclone-type mechanical spreader or its equivalent.
- b. Apply the Portland cement at a rate that ensures the pounds spread are within ±10 percent of the amount specified. Furnish a square-yard cloth, scales and personnel for checking the spread rate of cement placed.
- c. Apply cement on soils with a moisture content less than 120 percent of optimum.
- d. Apply cement on days when wind will not interfere with spreading.
- e. If the cement content is below the 10 percent limit in the mixing area, add additional cement to bring the affected area within the tolerance specified and recalibrate the mechanical spreader’s spread rate. If the cement content is more than the 10 percent limit in the mixing area, the excess quantity will be deducted from the Contractor’s pay for cement.
- f. Regulate operations to limit the application of cement to sections small enough so that all of the compacting and finishing operations specified in Subsection 301.3.05.B.7, Compacting and Finishing can be completed within the required time limits.
- g. Pass only spreading and mixing equipment over the spread cement. Operate this equipment so that it does not displace cement.
- h. Replace damaged cement at no additional cost to the Department when damage is caused by:
- • Hydration due to rain, before or during mixing operations
- • Spreading procedures contrary to the requirements mentioned above
- • Displacement by the Contractor’s equipment or other traffic

# Section 301 — Soil-Cement Construction

# 5. Mixing

Mix the material as follows:

Begin mixing as soon as practical after the cement is spread and continue until a homogeneous and uniform mixture is produced. If the equipment does not produce a homogeneous and uniform mixture meeting these specifications, make any necessary changes to meet the Engineer’s requirements.

# 6. Road Methods

# i. Multiple Pass Mixing

Perform multiple pass mixing as follows:

1. After spreading the cement, mix it with the material to be treated.
2. Ensure that the material has been adjusted for moisture as stated in Subsection 301.3.05.B.7.c, Moisture Control.
3. Continue mixing with successive passes until a uniform mixture of cement and soil, or soil-aggregate is obtained.
4. Immediately after the preliminary mixing of cement and soil or soil-aggregate, add water as needed to maintain or bring the mixture to within the moisture requirements of Subsection 301.3.05.B.7.c, Moisture Control.
5. Uniformly mix the additional water to incorporate it into the full depth of the mixture.

# 7. Compacting and Finishing

Compact and finish according to Subsection 301.3.05.B.7, Compacting and Finishing.

# B. Central Plant Mixing

# 1. Soil

Do the following:

1. Before introducing any soil into the mixer, pulverize it until 100 percent passes a 1-1/2 in. (37.5 mm) sieve.
2. Ensure that at least 80 percent of the soil, excluding any stone or gravel, passes through a No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve.
3. Have enough stockpile material meeting the requirements of Subsection 300.3.05.B, Mining and Mixing in a Pit for at least one day of base construction before operations begin.

# 2. Cement

Do the following:

1. Measure cement by weight. Uniformly add cement into the mixture. The cement incorporated, per ton (megagram) of soil, shall be within ±5 percent of the amount prescribed by the Engineer.
2. Perform cement checks that compare the actual percent cement in the mixture with the required percent cement specified in the approved Mix Design for the Project on each of the first two tankers supplying cement to the plant. If these checks are within the specified tolerance, one cement check per day will be required.
3. Perform and make available to the Engineer a minimum of four daily comparison checks between the certified scales and the plant computer to ensure the proper percentage of cement is being incorporated into the mixture between cement checks.
4. When a cement check is out of the specified tolerance, at least two, passing one-tanker checks, are required before returning to a one cement check per day basis. When three consecutive cement checks fail to meet the specified tolerance, discontinue soil-cement plant production. Correct the problem, and recalibrate the plant as specified in Subsection 300.3.06.A Monitoring Quality Control before resuming the work.

---

# Section 301 — Soil-Cement Construction

1. When the cement content exceeds the specified tolerance, the Department will deduct the excess cement from the Contractor’s pay for cement. When the cement content does not meet the specified tolerance, the Engineer will evaluate the strength of the affected area after 7 days.
2. Correct any areas of base with deficient strength as specified in the Strength Correction Chart at no additional cost to the Department, regardless of the percent of compaction. This correction also applies to the test section described in Subsection 301.3.05.B.7.a, Test Section.
3. Quantities of cement used in calibrating the plant will also be deducted from the Contractor’s pay for cement.

# 3. Mixing

1. Do the following:

1. Measure proportions of soil, cement, and water separately and accurately before mixing.
2. Charge all materials into the mixer together. Begin mixing immediately.
3. Mix until a homogeneous and uniform mixture is produced. If the final blend of materials is not homogeneously mixed or does not meet the moisture range specified in Subsection 301.3.05.B.7.c, Moisture Control, cease plant operations until corrections are made in the plant or to the materials.

# 4. Hauling

1. Do the following:

1. Deliver soil-cement material to the project.
2. Spread soil-cement material so that compaction can begin within 45 minutes after the soil, cement, and water have been charged into the mixer.
3. Protect the mixture in transit by using a securely fastened waterproof cover large enough to extend down over the sides and the end of the bed of each haul vehicle.

# 5. Spreading

Spread the soil-cement mixture as follows:

1. Use an approved mixture spreader as specified in Subsection 300.3.02.D, Mixture Spreader to obtain the specified thickness. Spread the mixture the full width of the area to be covered.
2. Ensure that trucks and other construction equipment, including motor graders, do not travel over the material until compaction equipment has made initial passes over the mixture.
3. Ensure that less than 30 minutes elapse between the placement of cement-treated material in adjacent lanes at any location, unless longitudinal joints are specified.

# 6. Thickness of Course

Compact the soil-cement base to a maximum thickness of 8 in. (200 mm). Place the full thickness in one course only and compact as specified in Subsection 301.3.05.B.7, Compacting and Finishing below.

---

# Section 301 — Soil-Cement Construction

# b. Time Limits

Observe the following time limits:

1. Begin compaction within 45 minutes of the time water is added to the soil-cement mixture.
2. Complete compaction within 2 hours.
3. Complete all operations in four hours, from adding cement to finishing the surface.

# c. Moisture Control

Control moisture as follows:

1. During compaction, ensure a uniform moisture content of the mixture that is between 100 and 120 percent of the optimum moisture content.
2. If the moisture content exceeds the tolerance at any time, cease operations immediately and make the adjustments necessary to bring the moisture content within tolerance.
3. Do not use materials that “pump” under construction traffic, regardless of moisture content.

# d. Additional Compaction Requirements

Perform the following additional compaction requirements:

1. Compact the soil-cement base, subbase, or shoulder course to at least 98 percent of the maximum dry density as determined in this Subsection.
2. Do not perform vibratory compaction on materials more than 1-1/2 hours old, measured from the time the cement was added to the mixture.
3. Uniformly compact the mixture and then fine-grade the surface to the line, grade, and cross-section shown on the Plans.
4. Loosened material accumulated during this process is considered waste and is to be removed from the Project. Do not use additional layers of cement-treated materials in order to conform to cross-sectional or grade requirements.
5. Use a pneumatic-tired roller to roll the finished surface until the surface is smooth, closely knit, free from cracks, and in conformance with the proper line, grade, and cross-section. If the Engineer requires, lightly apply water to the finished surface to aid in sealing the completed base and preparing the surface for priming.
6. At any place inaccessible to the roller, secure the required compaction with mechanical tampers approved by the Engineer. The same compaction requirements stated in the above subsection apply.

# e. Additional Finishing Requirements

Perform the following additional finishing requirements:

1. Use the automatically controlled screed equipment when required by Subsection 300.3.03.H, Fine Grading Machine of the Specifications. Control fine-grading for this requirement with sensing wires or a taut string line. Furnish, install, and maintain this operation as a part of this Pay Item. When automatically controlled screed equipment is not required, fine-grading with motor graders is permitted.
2. Fine-grade the surface of the cement-stabilized subbase for Portland cement concrete pavement or the cement-stabilized base for asphaltic concrete pavement.
3. Fine-grade immediately after placement and compaction. Roll the subbase again according to this subsection.

# 8. Construction Joints

Form construction joints as follows:

1. Form a straight transverse joint at the end of each day’s construction or when the work is interrupted so that the material cannot be compacted within the time limit specified in this subsection.
2. Create the straight transverse joint by cutting back into the completed work to form a true vertical face free of loose or shattered material.

---

# Section 301 — Soil-Cement Construction

c. Form the joint at least 2 ft. (600 mm) from the point at which the strike-off plate of the spreader comes to rest at the end of the day’s work, or at the point of interruption.

d. Form a longitudinal joint as described above if the soil-cement mixture is placed over a large area where it is impractical to complete the full width during one day’s work. Use the procedure for forming a straight transverse joint. Ensure that waste material is removed from the compacted base.

# 9. Prime

Apply bituminous prime to the finished surface of the base course at the end of each day or as soon as the Engineer determines it is practical. Apply prime only to an entirely moist surface. If weather delays prime application, apply prime as soon as the surface moisture is adequate. Apply prime according to Section 412. Apply a single #89 surface treatment layer over the primed base course.

# 10. Opening to Traffic

No traffic or equipment is permitted to operate on the finished base, subbase, or shoulders until the prime has hardened enough so that it does not pick up under traffic. For the first seven days after priming, traffic is restricted to lightweight vehicles such as passenger cars and pickup trucks. Vehicles with an average axle load exceeding 20,000 pounds (9 Mg) will not be allowed on the finished base or subbase at any time. Correct any failures caused by traffic at no additional cost to the Department.

# 11. Protection of Course

Maintain the base, subbase, or shoulder course constructed under these specifications until the Engineer determines that it has sufficiently cured and is ready to be covered with the next base or pavement course. Make repairs specified in Subsection 300.3.06.B, Repairing Defects whenever defects appear. This preservation action does not relieve the Contractor of his responsibility to maintain the work until final acceptance as specified in Section 105.

# 301.3.06 Quality Acceptance

# A. Compaction Tests

Test compaction as follows:

1. Determine the maximum dry density for central plant mix construction from representative samples of the material to be compacted according to GDT 19.
2. Determine the maximum dry density for mixed-in-place construction according to GDT 19 or GDT 67.
3. Determine the in-place density of the cement-stabilized base, subbase, or shoulders as soon as possible after compaction, but before the cement sets. Determine in-place density according to GDT 20, GDT 21, or GDT 59.

# B. Finished Surface Tests

Test the finished surface as follows:

1. Check the finished surface of the cement stabilized base, subbase, or shoulder course transversely.
2. Place a 15 ft. (4.5 m) straightedge parallel to the centerline. Additionally, use one of the following tools:
- A template, cut true to the required cross-section and set with a spirit level on non-super elevated sections
- A system of ordinates, measured from a string line
- A surveyor’s level
3. Ensure that ordinates measured from the bottom of the template, string line, or straightedge to the surface do not exceed 1/4 in. (6 mm) at any point. Rod readings shall not deviate more than 0.02 ft. (6 mm) from the required readings.
4. Correct any variations from requirements immediately, as specified in Subsection 300.3.05.D.

Section 301 — Soil-Cement Construction

# C. Tolerances

# 1. Thickness Measurements

a. Thickness requirements apply to shoulder construction where the Plans specify a uniform thickness, or
where the shoulders will be surfaced. Do the following:

b. Determine the thickness of the base, subbase, or shoulder course, by making as many checks as
necessary to determine the average thickness.

# 2. Deficient Thickness

a. If any measurement is deficient in thickness more than 1/2 in. (13 mm), make additional measurements to
determine the deficient area.

b. Correct any area deficient by more than 1/2 in. (13 mm) to the design thickness by using one of the
following methods according to these Specifications:

- Apply Asphaltic Concrete 9.5 mm Superpave.
- Remove material to the full depth of the course and reconstruct to the required thickness.

No payment will be made for any 9.5 mm Superpave asphaltic concrete applied to correct deficiencies
nor will payment be made for removing and reconstructing the deficient work.

# 3. Average Thickness

Average thickness is measured as follows:

a. The average thickness per linear mile (kilometer) is determined from all measurements within the mile
(kilometer) increments.

b. The average thickness shall not exceed the specified thickness by more than 1/2 in. (13 mm).

c. If the unit of payment is by the ton (megagram) or cubic yard (meter), and the average thickness for any
mile (kilometer) increment exceeds the allowable 1/2 in. (13 mm) tolerance, payment for the excess
quantity in that increment will be deducted.

d. The excess quantity is calculated by multiplying the average thickness that exceeds the allowable 1/2 in.
(13 mm) tolerance by the surface area of the base, subbase, or shoulder, as applicable.

# 4. Strength

Do the following:

a. Ensure that the strength of the soil-cement base, subbase, or shoulder course is at least 300 psi (2070
kPa), as determined from testing the unconfined compressive strength of cores from the completed
course in accordance with GDT 86.

b. If a strength test falls below 300 psi (2070 kPa), do the following:

- 1) Isolate the affected area by securing additional cores 75 ft. (22 meters) in each direction until passing
strengths are achieved.
- 2) Average all compressive strengths in the affected area to determine the basis for corrective work
according to the table below or the Engineer’s directions.

# 302.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 302.3.05 Construction

# A. Process

# 1. In-Place Mixing

a. The Engineer will determine the suitability of existing roadbed materials for inclusion in the base course.

b. Remove all roots, sod, or rock more than 3 in (75 mm) in diameter and all other harmful materials from the roadbed during processing.

c. Place additional new soil (sand) on the roadbed and spread it uniformly to the proper depth to obtain the Plan thickness of the compacted base course. Place materials only on dry, unfrozen subgrade or subbase.

d. Loosen and pulverize the material to be stabilized without disturbing or damaging the underlying subgrade or subbase. Add water as needed to assist pulverization.

- 100 percent of material shall pass the 1.5 in (37.5 mm) sieve.
- A minimum of 80 percent of the soil (exclusive of stones or gravel) shall pass the No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve.

e. Provide moisture content between 2 and 8 percent by weight of the soil before adding the bituminous material. The moisture content shall be adjusted under the Engineer’s direction.

1. Add water at the mixer using accurate gauging devices.
2. Ensure that the moisture is uniformly distributed.

f. Shape the material to obtain the grade and cross-section required in the Plans. Windrow the material uniformly only if the mixing plant operation requires.

g. Uniformly apply the bituminous material after adjusting the moisture content and shaping has been completed.

h. Apply the bituminous material only as temperatures allow per the following table.

|                        | Minimum        | Maximum         |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| RC-800 Cutback Asphalt | 160 °F (70 °C) | 210 °F (100 °C) |

i. Mix the sand-bituminous mixture in successive sections so that the roadway can be compacted full width in one operation. Ensure that a uniform mixture is produced.



---


# Section 302 — Sand-Bituminous Stabilized Base Course

# 2. Central Plant Mixing Method

- a. Thoroughly pulverize material so that 100 percent will pass through a 1.5 in. (37.5 mm) sieve and at least 80 percent of the soil, excluding any stone or gravel, will pass through a No. 4 (4.75 mm) sieve.
- b. Adjust the moisture content of the pulverized base material according to Subsection 302.3.05.A.1.d.
- c. Mix as follows:
- 1) Proportion the sand-bituminous material and water separately.
- 2) Charge all materials into the mixer together and mix immediately.
- d. Mix until a uniform mixture is produced.
- e. Ensure that the temperature of the bituminous material is between 160 °F (70 °C) and 210 °F (100 °C) for mixing.
- f. Spread the sand-bituminous mixture to the proper depth to obtain the thickness required on the Plans of the finished base course.
- • Use an approved spreader.
- • Place sand-bituminous material only on a dry subgrade or subbase.

# B. Quantity of Bituminous Material

The Engineer will determine the quantity of bituminous material required. Apply the bituminous material uniformly, using an amount within 5 percent of the required quantity. If bituminous material is applied at a rate more than 5 percent in excess of the required amount and it is considered detrimental, remove and reconstruct the section. If the application rate is more than 5 percent and the material is left in place, no payment will be made for bituminous material in excess of the 5 percent tolerance. Correct any shortage of bituminous material more than 5 percent less than the required amount by applying additional bituminous material. The cost of reapplying, remixing, and compacting will be included in this Pay Item at no additional cost to the Department.

# C. Extent of Application

Limit the application of the bituminous material so that aeration and compaction can begin immediately after mixing.

# D. Mixing

# 3. Preparing Mixture for Compaction

- a. Shape the base to line, grade, and cross-section indicated in the plans.
- b. Aerate the mixture as follows:
- 1) Begin aeration as soon as the prepared base is long enough to permit the operation of aeration equipment.
- 2) Loosen and turn the mixture with harrows, blades, or the equivalent, until the volatile solvents and water evaporate, and the mixture is tacky.
- c. If rain threatens the work, roll the surface enough to exclude as much rainwater as possible. Resume aeration as soon as weather permits.

# 4. Thickness of Courses

- a. Spread the base as follows:
- 1) Spread to a maximum compacted lift thickness of 8 in. (200 mm).
- 2) Lay the maximum lift thickness for which the specified compaction is obtained, otherwise lay the base in more than one course.

Section 302 — Sand-Bituminous Stabilized Base Course

E. Compacting and Finishing
Compact as soon as the condition of the material and the weather permit. Bring the base to line, grade, and cross-section. Roll until the full depth of the course is compacted to 95 percent of the maximum dry density of the sand, without bituminous material.
1. Single-Course Construction
After the base has been compacted, do the following:
a. Shape the course to line, grade, and cross-section again.
b. Roll the surface with a pneumatic-tired roller followed by a steel-wheel roller to seal the surface. Begin at the edges and work toward the center until the surface is smooth, closely knit, free from cracks, and in conformance with the proper line, grade, and cross section.
c. Correct any defects specified in Subsection 300.3.06.B, Repairing Defects.
2. Multiple-Course Construction
After compacting the first course, do the following:
a. Shape the surface again to line, grade, and cross-section.
b. Spread and compact the second and succeeding courses as previously described.
c. Finish the surface according to the procedure specified for Single-Course Construction, above.

G. Preservation of Base
Maintain the base in a smooth and acceptable condition until it is covered by other construction.
1. Make repairs to any defects as specified in Subsection 300.3.06.B, Repairing Defects.
2. Preserving the base as specified does not relieve the Contractor of the general duty to maintain The Work until it is accepted as specified in Section 105.

302.3.06 Quality Acceptance
A. Compaction Tests
Test compaction as follows:
1. Determine the maximum dry density from representative samples of the material before adding the bituminous material by GDT 7 or GDT 67.
2. Determine the in-place density of the base according to AASHTO T 191 or GDT 59.

B. Finished Surface Tests
Check the finished surface of the base, subbase, or shoulder course as follows:
1. Check the longitudinal surface using a 15 ft. (4.5 m) straightedge parallel to the centerline.
2. Check the transverse surface by using one of the following tools:
a. A template, cut true to the required cross-section and set with a spirit level on non-super elevated sections.
b. A system of ordinates, measured from a string line.
c. A surveyor’s level.

b. Correct any area deficient between 1/2 in. (13 mm) and 1 in. (25 mm) to the design thickness by using one of the following methods according to these Specifications:

- Apply Asphaltic Concrete 9.5 mm Superpave.
- Leave in place and accept payment for the materials and area (if the course is mixed in place) at ½ the Contract Unit Price for the deficient area.

c. Correct any area deficient in thickness by more than 1 in. (25 mm) by applying Asphaltic Concrete 9.5 mm Superpave or removing the material to the full depth of the course and reconstructing to the required thickness in accordance with these specifications.

d. If payment is made by the cubic yard (meter) or ton (megagram), payment for Asphaltic Concrete 9.5 mm Superpave to correct deficiencies will be made at the Contract Unit Price that applies to the course needing correction. Payment for additional material used in reconstructing an area will be made at the Contract Unit Price, but the removed material will be deducted from payment.

e. If payment is made by the square yard (meter), no payment will be made for additional material required to correct deficiencies or reconstructing deficient work.

# 3. Average Thickness

Average thickness is measured as follows:

a. The average thickness per linear mile (kilometer) is determined from all measurements within the mile (kilometer) increments except the areas deficient by more than 1/2 in. (13 mm) and not corrected.

b. The average thickness shall not exceed the specified thickness by more than 1/2 in. (13 mm).

c. If the basis of payment is per cubic yard (meter) or ton (megagram) and the average thickness for any mile (kilometer) increment exceeds the allowable 1/2 in. (13 mm) tolerance, the excess quantity in that increment will be deducted from the Contractor’s payments.

d. The excess quantity is calculated by multiplying the average thickness that exceeds the allowable 1/2 in. (13 mm) tolerance by the surface area of the base, subbase, or shoulder, as applicable.

e. If the basis of payment is per square yard (meter), no deduction will be made for excess thickness.

Mix and control the materials according to Subsection 300.3.05.B, Mining and Mixing in a Pit. Handle and place materials carefully to prevent fine and coarse materials from separating.

If placing only one kind of material on the prepared subgrade or subbase or adding only one kind of material to the roadbed to obtain the required mixture, place the material directly on the prepared roadbed and distribute uniformly.

If mixing together materials from more than one outside source, spread them in separate layers to the proper depth. Do this for each separate course, if placing the base in more than one course.

If creating topsoil or sand-clay from artificial mixtures, place the proper proportions of the required ingredients on the roadbed and distribute uniformly.

Use the following steps to spread, mix, and stabilize a base, subbase, or shoulder course.

1. Spreading
Spread material lengthwise up to 2,500 ft. (750 m) on the roadbed. If the material is too wet to mix, place additional material as the Engineer requires. Mix as soon as the moisture content reaches the proper level.
2. Mixing
Mix the material by one of the following methods, weather and moisture conditions permitting:

1. Plowing, Harrowing, and Blading
Without disturbing the underlying subgrade or subbase, plow the material to its full depth, then harrow with a disc harrow. Begin plowing both at the edges and the center, alternating back and forth as many times as necessary, to produce a thoroughly pulverized and homogeneous mixture.
2. Traveling Plant
A traveling plant mixer may be used instead of the method described above.
3. Stabilizing
After mixing and shaping the base, subbase, or shoulder course, spread stabilizer aggregate, if specified in the Contract or the plans. The quantity of stabilizer material required will be specified in pounds/square yard (kilograms/square meter) of road surface covered. The Department reserves the right to increase, decrease, or eliminate stabilizer material.

Spread and mix stabilizer aggregate with either the upper 4 in. (100 mm) or to the full depth of the course, as the Plans indicate. Uniformly incorporate the stabilizer aggregate into the course. Remix and reshape all sections of the course as needed.

When using stabilized subgrade as a base course, either permanently or temporarily (for example, as detours), prime according to Section 412.

Section 303 — Topsoil, Sand-Clay, or Chert Construction

# C. Compacting and Finishing

Use the following steps to compact and finish a base, subbase, or shoulder course.

1. Moisture Content
Ensure that the moisture content is uniformly distributed and within 90 to 120 percent of optimum. The Engineer will determine the percentage within this range that is appropriate for each job.
2. Compaction
If the base, subbase, or shoulder course is more than 8 in. (200 mm) thick, compact it in two courses of equal thickness. After placing and mixing the material, roll it until the course is uniformly compacted to 100 percent of the maximum dry density. Complete all courses of any section of construction started in the same day, weather permitting.

1. Single-Course Construction
1. Compact the surface by rolling, beginning at least 2 ft. (600 mm) outside of its edges.
2. Proceed toward the center until the finished surface is smooth, closely knit, and conforms to the proper line, grade, and cross-section.
3. Correct any defects according to Subsection 300.3.06.B, Repairing Defects.
2. Multiple-Course Construction
1. After compacting the first course, shape the surface again to line, grade, and cross-section.
2. Add water as necessary to develop the proper moisture content.
3. Spread and compact the second and any succeeding courses (including stabilizer aggregate, if required) without rolling the first course again.
4. Finish the surface according to the procedure specified for Subsection 303.3.05.C.2.a, Single-Course Construction.
3. Irregular Areas
In places inaccessible to the roller, obtain the required compaction with mechanical tampers approved by the Engineer. Apply the same density requirements as stated above.

# D. Protecting the Base, Subbase, or Shoulders

Maintain the course true to grade and cross-section. Until the course cures to the Engineer’s satisfaction, keep it free from ruts, ridges, and dust caused by traffic. Roll and add water as needed and repair defects as soon as they appear, as specified in Subsection 300.3.06.B, Repairing Defects.

# E. Priming the Base

After completing the base, apply Bituminous Prime according to Section 412. If the base is primed before base material classification test results are known, repair and re-prime any resulting defective areas at no additional cost to the Department.

# 310.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 310.3.05 Construction

# A. Placing Material

Use the central plant mix method unless producing aggregates (from an approved source or deposit) that conform to the requirements of Section 815. Use the following steps to mix base and spread subbase or shoulder course.

1. Mixing
When blending two sizes of aggregate, proportion the aggregate and water, if needed, into the central plant. Mix until producing a homogeneous and uniform mixture.
2. Spreading
To obtain the specified thickness, uniformly spread materials to the proper depth with a mixture spreader. Do not use materials containing frost or frozen particles.

1. One-Course Construction
Lay one course to a maximum thickness of 8 in. (200 mm) compacted.
2. Multiple-Course Construction
If the thickness of the base, subbase or shoulder course exceeds 8 in. (200 mm), construct it in 2 or more courses of equal thickness.

# B. Compacting Material

Use the following steps to compact and finish a base, subbase, or shoulder course.

1. Moisture Content
Ensure that the moisture content of materials is uniformly distributed and allows compaction to the specified density. Unless approved by the Office of Materials and Research, no graded aggregate will be shipped to a project when the moisture content of the material exceeds two percent of optimum moisture.
2. Compaction
After shaping the spread material to line, grade, and cross-section, roll to uniformly compact the course. If using Group 1 aggregate, roll to at least 98 percent of maximum dry density. If using Group 2 aggregate, roll to at least 100 percent of the maximum dry density.

If using graded aggregate mixtures composed of either group as base for paved shoulders 6 ft. (1.8 m) wide or less, compact to at least 96 percent of the maximum dry density. Regardless of compaction, ensure that the compacted base is sufficiently stable to support construction equipment without pumping. If the base material is unstable from too much moisture, dry and rework the base material. Dry and rework the underlying subgrade, if necessary.

1. One-Course Construction
1. After compaction, shape to the required grade, line, and cross-section.
2. Add water as necessary to develop the proper moisture content.
3. Roll until the surface is smooth, closely knit, and free of cracks.
4. Correct all defects according to Subsection 300.3.06.B, Repairing Defects.

Section 310 — Graded Aggregate Construction

b. Multiple-Course Construction

1. After compacting the first course, shape the surface again to line, grade, and cross section.
2. Add water as necessary to develop the proper moisture content.
3. Spread and compact the second and any succeeding courses without rolling the first course again.
4. Finish the surface according to the procedure specified for one-course construction.

c. Irregular Areas

In places inaccessible to the roller, obtain the required compaction with mechanical tampers approved by the Engineer. Apply the same density requirements as stated above in Subsection 310.3.05.B.

C. Finishing

Finish the surface of the subbase for Portland cement concrete pavement or the base of asphaltic concrete pavement with automatically controlled screed equipment when required by Subsection 300.3.02.H, Fine Grading Machine of the specifications. Furnish, install, and maintain the sensing wires needed to control the finish operation as a part of the Pay Item. When automatically controlled screed equipment is not required, fine grading with motor graders is permitted.

Finish immediately after the placing and compacting operations. After finishing, compact the subbase again, according to Subsection 310.3.05.B, Compacting Material.

D. Protecting the Base, Subbase or Shoulders

Maintain the course until the Engineer determines that it has cured sufficiently and is ready to prime. Maintain by additional wetting, rolling, and blading as necessary. Repair any defects according to Subsection 300.3.06.B, Repairing Defects.

These protection measures do not relieve the Contractor of maintaining the Work until final acceptance as specified in Section 105.

E. Priming the Base

Apply bituminous prime according to Section 412 unless using:

- Graded aggregate base under Portland cement concrete pavement
- Graded aggregate base under asphaltic concrete 5 in. (125 mm) or more in total thickness

310.3.06 Quality Acceptance

A. Compaction Tests

1. Determine the maximum dry density from representative samples of compacted material, according to AASHTO T180, Method D.
2. Determine the in-place density of finished courses according to GDT 21 or GDT 59, where applicable.



---

Section 310 — Graded Aggregate Construction

# B. Finished Surface

Check the finished surface of the base, subbase, or shoulder course as follows:

1. Check the longitudinal surface using a 15 ft. (4.5 m) straightedge parallel to the centerline.
2. Check the transverse surface by using one of the following tools:
- A template, cut true to the required cross-section and set with a spirit level on non-super elevated sections
- A system of ordinates, measured from a string line
- A surveyor’s level
3. Ensure that ordinates measured from the bottom of the template, string line, or straightedge, to the surface do not exceed 1/4 in. (6 mm) at any point. Rod readings shall not deviate more than 0.02 ft. (6 mm) from required readings.
4. Correct any variations from these requirements immediately according to Subsection 300.3.06.B, Repairing Defects.

# C. Thickness Tolerances

1. Thickness Measurements
1. Thickness requirements apply to shoulder construction where the plans specify a uniform thickness, or where the shoulders will be surfaced.
2. Determine the thickness of the base, subbase, or shoulder course, by making as many checks as necessary to determine the average thickness.
2. Deficient Thickness
1. If any measurement is deficient in thickness more than 1/2 in. (13 mm), make additional measurements to determine the deficient area.
2. Correct any area deficient between 1/2 in. (13 mm) and 1 in. (25 mm) to the design thickness by using one of the following methods according to these specifications:
- Add additional quantities of the same materials and reconstruct to the required thickness
- Leave in place and accept payment for the materials and area at ½ the Contract Unit Price for the deficient area.
3. Correct any area deficient in thickness by more than 1 in. (25 mm) by adding additional quantities of the same material and reconstructing to the required thickness in accordance with these Specifications.
4. If payment is made by the ton (megagram), payment for additional material to correct deficiencies will be made at the Contract Unit Price with no additional cost to the Department for scarification, mixing or compaction.
5. If payment is made by the square yard (meter), no payment will be made for additional material required to correct deficiencies or for reconstructing deficient work.
3. Average Thickness
1. The average thickness per linear mile (kilometer) is determined from all measurements within the mile (kilometer) increments except the areas deficient by more than 1/2 in. (13 mm) and not corrected.
2. The average thickness shall not exceed the specified thickness by more than 1/2 in. (13 mm).
3. If the basis of payment is per ton (megagram), and the average thickness for any mile (kilometer) increment exceeds the allowable 1/2 in. (13 mm) tolerance, the excess quantity in that increment will be deducted from the Contractor’s payments.
4. The excess quantity is calculated by multiplying the average thickness that exceeds the allowable 1/2 in. (13 mm) tolerance by the surface area of the base, subbase, or shoulder.
5. If the basis of payment is per square yard (meter), no deduction will be made for excess thickness.

Section 315 — Cement Stabilized Reclaimed Base Construction (CSRB)

# 315.3 Construction Requirements

# 315.3.01 Personnel

Ensure that only experienced and capable personnel operate equipment.

# 315.3.02 Equipment

Equipment used in CSRB construction must meet the following requirements and be approved by the Engineer prior to the beginning of construction. All equipment shall be in satisfactory condition and capable of its intended purpose. The Engineer may at any time reject any equipment that is deemed unsafe, erratic, or produces an inadequate performance.

Note: Equipment type, size, operation and condition are subject to the Engineer’s approval and must be adjusted and/or replaced upon their request.

# A. Reclaimer

CSRB will require a reclaimer unit that meets the following requirements:

1. Designed expressly for reclamation capable of pulverizing and mixing through asphaltic pavement, granular/soil base, Subbases, and subgrade down to depths of at least 12 in. (300mm).
2. Having a cutting drum with a minimum width of 8 ft. (2m).
3. Capable of continuously mixing materials to a homogenous blend and at a consistent depth.
4. Powered by an engine of at least 500 horsepower with steerable front and rear wheels.
5. Controlled by an electronic metering system capable of injecting mix water directly into the mixing chamber and has automatic sensors to monitor water application and mixing depth.

# B. Spreader

For CSRB construction, use a cyclone-type mechanical spreader or its equivalent that will spread Portland cement in a relatively dust-free process. Spreader must have an electronic or mechanical metering system which monitors the application rate.

Note: The use of pneumatic tubes to transfer cement or lime directly onto the roadway will not be allowed.

# C. Additional Equipment (Water Truck, Compaction and Grading equipment, and Prime Distributer)

Additional equipment necessary to complete the work must be in satisfactory condition and proper for its intended purpose. Compactive equipment includes a sheep’s foot roller, vibratory steel wheel roller and a pneumatic rubber tire roller. Use the correct size/type rollers or combination thereof that is capable of achieving the required density. A pressure distributor that complies with GDOT Standard Specifications/Subsection 424.3.02.B will be required to apply the bituminous prime coat.

Note: Equipment type, size, operation and condition are subject to the Engineer’s approval and must be adjusted and/or replaced upon their request.

# 315.3.03 Preparation

Prior to commencing reclaiming operations, blade grass and excess soil a minimum of 12 in. (300mm) from the edge of pavement. Locate, mark and preserve existing centerline, manholes, and utilities (gas, water, and electric lines). Relocate mailboxes and other appurtenances within such proximity to the roadway as to risk damage or interfere with the work. Remove sections of driveway aprons in the right-of-way where necessary to permit the reclaimer to operate without damaging the machinery or driveway pavement. If necessary, saw-cut a neat parallel line to the proposed edge of pavement and remove the concrete along the road. After all work is complete, replace appurtenances to their original location as nearly as possible.

Section 315 — Cement Stabilized Reclaimed Base Construction (CSRB)

# 315.3.04 Construction

# A. Weather Limitations

1. Mix only when the weather permits the course to be finished without interruption and within the time specified.
2. Mix materials only when the moisture of the materials to be used in the mixture meets the specified limits.
3. Begin mixing only when the air temperature is above 40°F in the shade and rising.

# B. Moisture Adjustment

Adjust the moisture content of the roadway materials to within 100 to 120 percent of the optimum moisture immediately before spreading the cement. The optimum moisture content is determined by the Job Mix Design and can be adjusted by the Engineer.

# C. Cement Application

1. Apply cement on days when wind will not interfere with spreading.
2. Apply cement at the rate specified on the Job Mix Design (as established by GDT-65) and mix to the depth shown on the Plans. The Engineer may alter the spread rate during the progress of construction if necessary. Maintain the application rate within + 10 percent of that specified by the Engineer.
3. Provide both equipment and personnel to measure the application rate of cement placed. Each tanker of cement shall be checked by using a square yard cloth/certified scales and by determining the overall coverage area of each tanker. Multiple checks may be necessary to ensure that the spread rate is maintained within the ± 10 percent limit.
4. If the cement content falls below the 10 percent limit in the mixing area, add additional cement to bring the affected area within the tolerance specified, make necessary adjustments to the spreader, and perform additional checks to ensure the problem is corrected. If the cement content is more than the 10 percent limit in the mixing area, the excess quantity will be deducted from the Contractor’s pay for cement.
5. Regulate operations to limit the application of cement to sections small enough so that all of the mixing, compacting, and finishing operations can be completed within the required time limits.
6. Pass only spreading and mixing equipment over the spread cement and operate this equipment so that it does not displace cement.
7. Replace damaged cement at no cost to the Department when damage is caused by:
1. Hydration due to rain, before or during mixing operations.
2. Spreading procedures are contrary to the requirements stated above.
3. Displacement by the Contractor’s equipment or other traffic.

# D. Mixing

1. Begin mixing as soon as possible after the cement is spread and continue until a homogeneous and uniform mixture is produced. The Engineer at any time may require adjustments or replacement of equipment if a homogeneous and uniform mixture conforming to these Specifications is not achieved.
2. Continue pulverizing until the base mixture is uniform in color and conforms to the following gradation requirements:
1. 100 percent passing the 3 in. sieve (76.1mm) or the natural size of the in-situ aggregate.
2. 55 percent of the roadway material, excluding gravel, passes the No. 4 sieve (4.75mm).
3. Add water as needed to maintain or bring the moisture content to within the moisture requirements immediately after the preliminary mixing of the cement and roadway material.
4. Mix the additional water homogeneously into the full depth of the mixture.

Section 315 — Cement Stabilized Reclaimed Base Construction (CSRB)

# E. Compaction and Finishing

# 1. Test Section

- A test section shall be constructed with the first tanker of cement delivered to the project. The length of the test section will be determined by area in which the entire tanker of cement will cover.
- The Engineer will evaluate compaction, moisture, homogeneity of mixture, thickness of stabilization, and finished base surface. If the Engineer deems necessary, revise the compaction procedure or replace equipment.

# 2. Time Limits

- Complete compaction within 2 hours after the cement has been applied.
- Do not perform vibratory compaction on materials more than 90 minutes old, measured from the time cement was added to the mixture.
- Complete all operations within 4 hours from adding cement to finishing the surface.

# 3. Moisture Control

- During compaction, ensure that the moisture is uniformly distributed throughout the mixture at a level of between 100 and 120 percent of the optimum moisture content.

# 4. Compaction Requirements

- Use a sheep’s foot roller, steel wheel roller or pneumatic-tired roller for initial compactive effort unless an alternate method is approved by the Engineer.
- Compact the cement-stabilized base course to at least 98 percent of the maximum dry density established on the Job Mix Design.
- Uniformly compact the mixture and then shape to the grade, line, and cross-section shown on the Plans.
- Remove all loosened material accumulated during the shaping process. Do not use additional layers of cement-treated materials in order to conform to cross-sectional or grade requirements.
- Use a pneumatic-tired roller to roll the finished surface until it is smooth, closely knit, and free from cracks or deformations, and conforming to the proper line, grade, and cross-section.
- In places inaccessible to the roller, obtain the required compaction with mechanical tampers approved by the Engineer. Apply the same compaction requirements as stated above in Subsection 315.3.04.E.4.
- Perform grading operations immediately after the placement and compaction operations. Roll the stabilized base course again with a pneumatic-tired roller.

# F. Construction Joints

# 1.

- Form a straight transverse joint at the end of each day’s construction or whenever the work is interrupted.

# 2.

- Create the straight transverse joint by cutting back into the completed work to form a true vertical face free of loose or shattered material.

# 3.

- Form the joint at least 2 ft. (0.6m) from the point where the spreader strike-off plate comes to rest at the end of the day’s work, or at the point of interruption.

# 4.

- Form a longitudinal joint as described above if cement-stabilized mixture is placed over a large area where it is impractical to complete the full width during one day’s work. Use the procedure for forming a straight transverse joint. Remove all waste material from the compacted base.

Section 315 — Cement Stabilized Reclaimed Base Construction (CSRB)

# G. Priming the Base

1. The surface of the completed base course must be moist cured until the bituminous prime is applied.
2. Apply prime only to an entirely moist surface. If weather delays prime application, apply prime as soon as the surface moisture is adequate.
3. Apply bituminous prime according to GDOT Standard Specifications/Section 412 as soon as possible and in no case later than 24 hours after completion of the finishing operations.
4. Protect finished portions of the cement-stabilized base course that are used by equipment in the construction of an adjoining section to prevent marring or damaging of the completed work. Protect the stabilized area from freezing during the curing period.

# H. Opening to Traffic

1. Correct any failures caused by traffic at no additional cost to the Department. Make repairs specified in GDOT Standard Specifications/Subsection 300.3.06.B whenever defects appear. This preservation action does not relieve the Contractor of his responsibility to maintain the work until final acceptance as specified in GDOT Standard Specifications/Section 105.

# 315.3.05 Quality Acceptance

# A. Compaction Tests

1. Determine the maximum dry density from representative samples of compacted material, according to GDOT Test Method/GDT 19 or GDT 67.
2. Determine the in-place density of finished courses according to GDOT Test Method/GDT 20, GDT 21 or GDT 59 as soon as possible after compaction, but before the cement sets.

# B. Gradation Tests

1. Ensure that the gradation of the completely mixed cement-stabilized base course meets the requirements as stated above in Subsection 315.3.04.D.2.

# C. Finished Surface Tests

1. Check the finished surface of the cement-stabilized base course transversely using one of the following tools:
1. A template, cut true to the required cross-section and set with a spirit level on non-super elevated sections.
2. A system of ordinates measured from a string line.
3. A surveyor’ level.
2. Ensure the ordinates measured from the bottom of the template, string line, or straightedge, to the surface do not exceed ½ in. (12.5mm) at any point.

# Section 315 — Cement Stabilized Reclaimed Base Construction (CSRB)

# D. Thickness Tolerances

1. Determine the thickness of the cement-stabilized base course by making as many checks as necessary to
determine the average thickness, but not less than one check per 1000 ft. (300m) per 2 lanes. Checks shall be
taken after the completion of the base course and prior to priming.
2. If any measurement is deficient in thickness by more than ½ in. (12.5mm), make additional measurements to
isolate the affected area. Correct any area deficient by more than ½ in. (12.5mm) to the design thickness by
using one of the following methods:
1. Apply GDOT approved asphaltic concrete 9.5mm Superpave.
2. Reconstruct to the required thickness.

No payment will be made for any Asphaltic Concrete 9.5mm Superpave used to correct deficiencies nor will
payment be made for removing and reconstructing the deficient work.
3. If any measurement exceeds thickness by more than ½ in. (12.5mm), make additional measurements to
isolate the affected area. If the basis of payment is per cubic yard and the average thickness for any mile
increment exceeds the allowable ½ in. (12.5mm) tolerance the excess quantity in that increment will be
deducted from the Contractor’s payments. The excess quantity is calculated by multiplying the average
thickness that exceeds the allowable ½ in. (12.5mm) tolerance by the surface area of the base, as applicable.

# 315.4 Measurement

# A. Cement-Stabilized Base Course

Measure the surface length along the centerline when payment is specified by the square yard. The width is
specified on the plans. Measure irregular areas, such as turnouts and intersections, by the square yard.

# B. Portland Cement

Measure Portland cement by the ton.

# C. Bituminous Prime

Bituminous prime is not measured for separate payment. Include the cost of furnishing and applying bituminous
prime according to the provisions of GDOT Standard Specifications/Section 412 in the Unit Price Bid for each
individual base item.

# 315.5 Payment

# A. Cement-Stabilized Base Course

Cement-stabilized base, in-place and accepted, will be paid for at the Contract Unit Price per square yard.
Payment will be full compensation for roadbed preparation, mixing on the road, shaping, pulverizing, watering,
compaction, defect repair, bituminous prime and maintenance.

# B. Portland Cement

Portland cement will be paid for at the Contract Unit Price per ton. Payment is full compensation for furnishing,
hauling, and applying the material. Only Type I or Type II Portland cement incorporated into the finished course
will be paid for and no payment will be made for cement used to correct defects due to the Contractor’s
negligence, faulty equipment, or error.

Section 317 — Reconstructed Base Course

# 317.3.05 Construction

# A. Methods

With the following methods, bring the existing road surface up to the established grade to conform to the cross-section indicated on the plans.

1. Remove Unsuitable Material
When existing roadbed material is unsuitable for use, remove and replace it with approved material.
2. Remove and Stockpile Existing Base
If removing roadbed materials to stockpile for further use, as shown on the plans, follow these steps:

1. Scarify and pulverize the roadbed to the specified depth, without removing the subgrade or shoulder material.
2. Deposit material in stockpiles on thoroughly clean surfaces.
3. Minimize segregation of the separate ingredients when stockpiling the material.
3. Scarify
If leaving roadbed material in place, scarify below the upper surface of the finished base course to a uniform depth, and to the entire width of the finished base course, to:

1. Eliminate all depressions and irregularities
2. Allow the bonding of any additional material to the old base
3. Reshape to the required cross-section

If the surface has been treated with a bituminous material, break it down sufficiently to incorporate into the existing base. If this is impossible, remove it from the base and dispose of it as the Engineer directs.
4. Add New Material
Where unsuitable material has been removed, shape the subgrade or remaining material as directed to add material. Use new material that conforms to the governing Specification.
5. Replace Stockpiled Material
After shaping the subgrade, place stockpiled material along with any additional new material on the roadbed. If the existing roadbed material is satisfactory for use, but deficient in thickness after scarifying, bring the surface to the grade and depth indicated on the Plans by:

1. Removing all material larger than 3 in. (75 mm) in diameter
2. Adding new material

# B. Mix and Shape

After adding the required amount of new material, thoroughly mix the old and new base course. Mix according to the requirements set out under the Specifications for the type of base being constructed. During the mixing and shaping operations, add sufficient quantities of water, if needed, to secure proper moisture conditions. After mixing, shape the entire roadbed to the required grade and cross-section. Remix and reshape all or any part of the base as necessary, to obtain the desired results.

# C. Compact and Finish

After mixing and shaping the base material, compact and finish according to the specifications for the type of base being reconstructed.

# D. Prime

After compaction, preserve the base by priming according to Section 412.

Section 326 — Portland Cement Concrete Subbase

# 326.3.03 Preparation

Before placing Portland cement concrete subbase, prepare the roadbed as required by the plans and the specifications.

# 326.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 326.3.05 Construction

Produce Portland cement concrete subbase by combining authorized proportions of approved materials in homogeneous, uniform batches. Ensure that the grade immediately under the subbase does not contribute to deficient thicknesses of either the subbase or pavement. Employ methods to ensure that subbase placement equipment does not cause deficient thickness to areas supporting the equipment.

Produce the subbase as follows:

# A. Mixing

The Engineer will determine the design proportions of the required materials based upon mixes prepared in the laboratory or trials performed during construction. Determine the batch weights required to produce the necessary quantity. Measure the cement, aggregates, and water separately, to the accuracy specified above. Continue mixing until producing a homogeneous and uniform mixture. Mix concrete produced in a stationary central mix plant for a minimum of 60 seconds, after all materials have entered the drum. A reduction of mix time may be allowed if representative tests show that the concrete meets the requirements of ASTM C 94, Requirements for Uniformity. In all cases, mix for at least 50 seconds. Ensure that transit mixed concrete meets the requirements of Subsection 500.3.04.E.3.

# B. Placing

Spread the mixture on the grade with minimum rehandling. Hand spread with shovels if necessary. Do not place Portland cement concrete on muddy, puddled, or frozen subgrade.

NOTE: Do not allow workers to walk in fresh concrete with shoes coated with dirt or other foreign substances.

# C. Consolidating

Consolidate the mixture by vibrating the full length, width, and depth of the section. Ensure that vibration does not produce puddling or excessive grout accumulation. If consolidation and density are not satisfactory, stop placement and furnish methods or equipment to produce subbase conforming to the specifications.

# D. Finishing

Finish the mixture to the proper cross-section. Use equipment that produces a uniform surface free of irregular, rough, or porous areas. Use a tube float or other finishing device approved by the Engineer to provide a smooth surface. Unless the Engineer permits, do not add water to the surface to aid finishing.

# E. Forming Construction Joints

Form a construction joint when mixture placement is interrupted for more than one hour. Construct joints according to Subsection 430.3.05 unless the Engineer waives the requirements concerning reinforcement. Ensure that the straightedge tolerance is 3/8 in. (10 mm) in 20 ft. (6 m).

# F. Curing

Cure the mixture according to Subsection 430.3.05.L.1. Apply compound for the impervious membrane method at the rate of 200 ft.²/gal (5 m²/L) or less. Apply a second application of curing compound just before placing the pavement to act as a bond breaker. Apply the second application at the same rate as the first application.

358

Section 326 — Portland Cement Concrete Subbase

# G. Preserving the Subbase

Maintain the subbase until it is covered by the succeeding pavement course.

1. Place the pavement course on the subbase only after the mixture has cured for 7 days.
2. Operate the spreader and slip form paver on the subbase after 7 days, but do not use the subbase as a haul road for loaded trucks, equipment, or other vehicles for 14 days.
1. Construct earth ramps and barricades to move traffic across the subbase.
2. Remove and replace areas damaged by vehicles or equipment at no additional cost to the Department.

# H. Weather Limitations

1. Do not place the subbase mixture when the air temperature in the shade is less than 40 °F (5 °C) and falling. Wait until the air temperature is at least 35 °F (2 °C) and rising.
2. Protect the subbase from rain until the surface has sufficiently hardened to prevent marring.
3. Protect the subbase from cold weather according to Subsection 430.3.05.L.4.

# 326.3.06 Quality Acceptance

Check the finished surface transversely by a system of ordinates measured from a string line. Also check the surface with a 20 ft. (6 m) straightedge placed parallel to the centerline. Remove or correct deviations in excess of 3/8 in. (10 mm) in 20 ft. (6 m). If the Engineer permits, correct low areas by increasing the thickness of the surface course at no additional cost to the Department.

# A. Composition of Subbase Mixture

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# 400.2.01 Delivery, Storage, and Handling

Storage of material is allowed in a properly sealed and insulated system for up to 24 hours. Ensure Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA), Open-Graded Friction Course (OGFC), or Porous European Mix (PEM) mixtures are not stored more than 12 hours. Mixtures other than SMA, OGFC, or PEM may be stored up to 72 hours in a sealed and insulated system, equipped with an auxiliary inert gas system, with the Engineer’s approval. Segregation, lumpiness, drain-down, or stiffness of stored mixture is cause for rejection of the mixture. The Engineer will not approve using a storage or surge bin if the mixture segregates, loses excessive heat, or oxidizes during storage.

The Engineer may obtain mixture samples or recover asphalt cement according to GDT 119 or AASHTO T 324. AASHTO T 315, AASHTO T 202, or AASHTO T 49 will be used to perform viscosity and penetration tests to determine how much asphalt hardening has occurred. AASHTO T-324 will be used to perform Hamburg Wheel Tracking Device testing to determine rutting and moisture damage susceptibility.

# A. Vehicles for Transporting and Delivering Mixtures

Ensure trucks used for hauling bituminous mixtures have tight, clean, smooth beds. Follow these guidelines when preparing vehicles to transport bituminous mixtures:

1. Use an approved releasing agent from QPL 39 in the transporting vehicle beds, if necessary, to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bed. Ensure the releasing agent is not detrimental to the mixture. When applying the agent, drain the excess agent from the bed before loading. Remove from the project any transporting vehicles determined to contain unapproved releasing agents.
2. Protect the mixture with a waterproof cover large enough to extend over the sides and ends of the bed. Securely fasten the waterproof cover before the vehicle begins moving.
3. Insulate the front end and sides of each bed with an insulating material with the following specifications:
- Consists of builders insulating board or equivalent;
- Has a minimum “R” value of 4.0; and
- Can withstand approximately 400 °F (200 °C) temperatures.

Install the insulating material so it is protected from loss and contamination. A “Heat Dump Body” may be used in lieu of insulation of the bed. “Heat Dump Body” refers to any approved transport vehicle capable of diverting engine exhaust and transmitting heat evenly throughout the dump body to keep asphalt at required temperature. Mark the “Heat Dump Body” clearly with “OPEN” and “CLOSE” position at the exhaust diverter. Install a padlock and lock it in the “OPEN” position when the “Heat Dump Body” is used to transport bituminous mixtures.
4. Mark each transporting vehicle with a clearly visible identification number.
5. Create a hole in each side of the bed so the temperature of the loaded mixture can be checked. Ensure the placement of these holes are located to assure the thermometer is being placed in the hot mix asphaltic concrete mixtures. Ensure the mixture is delivered to the roadway at a temperature within ± 20 °F (± 11 °C) of the temperature on the job mix formula. If the Engineer determines a truck may be hazardous to the project or adversely affect the quality of the work, remove the truck from the project.

# B. Containers for Transporting, Conveying, and Storing Bituminous Material

To transport, convey, and store bituminous material, use containers free of foreign material and equipped with sample valves. Bituminous material will not be accepted from conveying vehicles if material has leaked or spilled from the containers.

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# 7. Net Weight Weighing Mechanisms

Certify the accuracy of the net weight weighing mechanisms by an approved registered scale serviceperson at least once every 6 months. Check the accuracy of net weight weighing mechanisms at the beginning of Project production and thereafter as directed by the Engineer. Check mechanism accuracy as follows:

1. Weigh a load on a set of certified commercial truck scales. Ensure the difference between the printed total net weight and weight obtained from the commercial scales is no greater than 4 lbs./1,000 lbs. (4 kg/Mg) of load.
Check the accuracy of the bitumen scales as follows:

- Use standard test weights.
- If the checks indicate printed weights are out of tolerance, have a registered scale serviceperson check the batch scales and certify the accuracy of the printer.
- While the printer system is out of tolerance and before its adjustment, continue production only if using a set of certified truck scales to determine the truck weights.
2. Ensure plants using batch scales maintain ten 50 lb. (25 kg) standard test weights at the plant site to check batching scale accuracy.

3. Provide flow indicators or sensing devices for the system and interlock them with the plant controls to interrupt the mixture production if the crumb rubber introduction output rate is not within the ± 6 percent tolerance given above. This interlock will immediately notify the operator if the targeted rate exceeds introduction tolerances. All plant production will cease if the introduction rate is not brought back within tolerance after 30 seconds. When the interlock system interrupts production and the plant has to be restarted, upon restarting operations; ensure the modifier system runs until a uniform feed can be observed on the output display. Ensure all mix produced prior to obtaining a uniform feed is rejected.
4. Introduce the crumb rubber modifier as follows:

- When a batch type plant is used, add the rubber to the aggregate in the weigh hopper. Increase the batch dry mixing time by 15 to 20 seconds from the time the aggregate is completely emptied into the mixer to ensure the modifiers are uniformly distributed prior to the injection of asphalt cement into the mixer. Increase the batch wet mix time by 15 to 20 seconds to ensure the crumb rubber modifier is uniformly blended with the asphaltic cement.
- When a continuous or drier-drum type plant is used, add the rubber to the aggregate and uniformly disperse prior to the injection of asphalt cement. The point of introduction in the drum mixer will be approved by the Engineer prior to production. Ensure the crumb rubber modifier will not become entrained in the exhaust system of the drier or plant and will not be exposed to the drier flame at any point after induction.
5. No separate measurement and payment will be made if Contractor elects to utilize crumb rubber.

This may be done with loose fibers and a Fiber Metering Device or may be done by using pre-measured packages that are specifically designed to disintegrate within the mixing cycle. Increase the batch dry mixing time by 8 to 12 seconds from the time the aggregate is completely emptied into the mixer to ensure the fibers are uniformly distributed prior to the injection of asphalt cement into the mixer.
- When a continuous or drier-drum type plant is used, add the fiber to the aggregate or RAP material at the beginning of the mixing cycle and uniformly disperse prior to the injection of asphalt cement. The final configuration of the fibers at the point when mixing begins, should closely resemble the fibers as they are packaged. Pre-distributing the fibers into their individual form should be avoided. Ensure the fibers will not become entrained in the exhaust system of the drier or plant. The producer should inspect their plant for any protrusions that may accumulate fibers and create the potential for fiber clumps.
- When a continuous or drier-drum type plant is used for limited production volumes, the addition of the fibers may be done by using pre-measured packages that are specifically designed to disintegrate within the mixing cycle and adding them directly into the RAP port of the plant. Because this is not an automated process, a written protocol must be supplied by the producer to demonstrate how they will attain the dosage requirement, and documentation must be supplied by the material manufacturer assuring this method will produce the desired random fiber distribution.

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# C. Equipment at Project Site

# 1. Cleaning Equipment

Provide sufficient hand tools and power equipment to clean the roadway surface before placing the bituminous tack coat. Use power equipment complying with Subsection 424.3.02.F, Power Broom and Power Blower.

# 2. Pressure Distributor

To apply the bituminous tack coat, use a pressure distributor complying with Subsection 424.3.02.B, Pressure Distributor.

# 3. Bituminous Pavers

To place hot mix asphaltic concrete, use bituminous pavers that can spread and finish courses that are:

- As wide and deep as indicated on the plans
- True to line, grade, and cross section
- Smooth
- Uniform in density and texture

# a. Continuous Line and Grade Reference Control

Furnish, place, and maintain the supports, wires, devices, and materials required to provide continuous line and grade reference control to the automatic paver control system.

# b. Automatic Screed Control System

Equip the bituminous pavers with an automatic screed control system actuated from sensor-directed mechanisms or devices that will maintain the paver screed at a pre-determined transverse slope and elevation to obtain the required surface.

# c. Transverse Slope Controller

Use a transverse slope controller capable of maintaining the screed at the desired slope within ± 0.1 percent. Do not use continuous paving set-ups resulting in unbalanced screed widths or off-center breaks in the main screed cross section unless approved by the Engineer.

# d. Screed Control

Equip the paver to permit the following four modes of screed control. Ensure the method used is approved by the Engineer.

- Automatic grade sensing and slope control
- Automatic dual grade sensing
- Combination automatic and manual control
- Total manual control

Ensure the controls are referenced with a taut string or wire set to grade, or with a ski-type device or mobile reference at least 30 ft. (9 m) long when using a conventional ski. Approved non-contacting laser or sonar-type skis listed on QPL 91 “Georgia’s List of Approved Non-contacting Laser and Sonar-type Electronic Grade and Slope Controls” may be used in lieu of conventional 30 ft. (9 m) skis. Under limited conditions, a short ski or shoe may be substituted for a long ski on the second paver operating in tandem, or when the reference plane is a newly placed adjacent lane. Automatic screed control is required on all projects; however, when the Engineer determines that project conditions prohibit the use of such controls, the Engineer may waive the grade control, or slope control requirements, or both.

# e. Paver Screed Extension

When the laydown width requires a paver screed extension, use bolt-on screed extensions to extend the screeds, or use an approved mechanical screed extension device. When the screed is extended, add auger extensions to assure a length of no more than 18 in. (0.5 m) from the auger to the end gate of the paver. Auger extensions may be omitted when paving variable widths. Ensure the paver is equipped with tunnel extensions when the screed and augers are extended.



---

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

NOTE: Do not use extendible strike-off devices instead of approved screed extensions. Only use a strike-off device in areas that would normally be luted in by hand labor.

# 4. Compaction Equipment

Ensure that the compaction equipment is in good mechanical condition and can compact the mixture to the required density. The compaction equipment number, type, size, operation, and condition is subject to the Engineer’s approval.

# 5. Materials Transfer Vehicle (MTV)

a. Use a Materials Transfer Vehicle (MTV) when placing asphaltic concrete mixtures on projects on the state route system with the following conditions. If a project fails to meet any one of the following conditions, the MTV’s use is not required other than during the placement of SMA, PEM and OGFC mixtures. MTVs are required during the placement of SMA, PEM and OGFC mixtures regardless of ADT, project length and mixture tonnage unless waived at the discretion of the Office of Materials and Testing.

# 1) When to use:

- The two-way ADT is equal to or greater than 6000
- The project length is equal to or greater than 3000 linear feet (915 linear meters)
- The total tonnage (megagrams) of all asphaltic concrete mixtures is greater than 2000 tons (1815 Mg)

# 2) Where to use:

- Mainline of the traveled way
- Collector/distributor (C/D) lanes on Interstates and limited access roadways
- Leveling courses at the Engineer’s discretion

# 3) Do not use the MTV for the following conditions:

- A resurfacing project that only 9.5 mm mix is required.
- A project with lane width that is equal or less than 11 ft. (3.4 m).
- A passing lane only project.
- When noted on the plans.

b. Ensure the MTV and conventional paving equipment meet the following requirements:

# 1) MTV

- Has a truck unloading system which receives mixture from the hauling equipment and independently deliver mixtures from the hauling equipment to the paving equipment.
- Has mixture remixing capability approved by the Office of Materials and Testing and is listed on QPL 88 “Georgia’s List of Approved Materials Transfer Vehicles”.
- Provides to the paver a homogeneous, non-segregated mixture of uniform temperature with no more than 20 °F (11 °C) difference between the highest and lowest temperatures when measured transversely across the width of the mat in a straight line at a distance of one foot to twenty-five feet (0.3 m to 7.6 m) from the screed while the paver is operating. Ensure that the MTV is capable of providing the paver a consistent material flow that is sufficient to prevent the paver from stopping between truck exchanges.

# 2) Conventional Paving Equipment

- Has a paver hopper insert with a minimum capacity of 14 tons (13 Mg) installed in the hopper of conventional paving equipment when an MTV is used.



---

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

c. If the MTV malfunctions during spreading operations, discontinue placement of hot mix asphaltic concrete after there is sufficient mix placed to maintain traffic in a safe manner. However, placement of hot mix asphaltic concrete in a lift not exceeding 2 in. (50 mm) may continue until any additional hot mix in transit at the time of the malfunction has been placed. Cease spreading operations thereafter until the MTV is operational.

d. Ensure the MTV is empty when crossing a bridge and is moved across without any other Contractor vehicles or equipment on the bridge. Move the MTV across a bridge in a travel lane and not on the shoulder. Ensure the speed of the MTV is no greater than 5 mph (8 kph) without any acceleration or deceleration while crossing a bridge.

# 400.3.03 Preparation

# A. Prepare Existing Surface

Prepare the existing surface as follows:

1. Clean the Existing Surface. Before applying hot mix asphaltic concrete pavement, clean the existing surface to the Engineer’s satisfaction.
2. Patch and Repair Minor Defects
1. Before placing leveling course:
1. Correct potholes and broken areas requiring patching in the existing surface and base as directed by the Engineer.
2. Cut out, trim to vertical sides, and remove loose material from the areas to be patched.
3. Prime or tack coat the area after being cleaned. Compact patches to the Engineer’s satisfaction. Material for patches does not require a job mix formula but must meet the gradation range shown in Section 828. The Engineer must approve the asphalt content to be used.
3. Apply Bituminous Tack Coat
Apply the tack coat according to Section 413. The Engineer will determine the application rate, which must be within the limitations in Tables 2A and 2B.

| Tack Uses                                               | Minimum     | Maximum     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Under OGFC and PEM Mixes                                | 0.06 (0.27) | 0.08 (0.36) |
| All Other Mixes                                         | 0.04 (0.18) | 0.06 (0.27) |
| Non-tracking Hot Applied Polymer Modified Tack (NTHAPT) | 0.06 (0.27) | 0.18 (0.81) |

Note 1: On thin leveling courses and freshly placed asphaltic concrete mixes, reduce the application rate to 0.02 to 0.04 gal/yd² (0.09 to 0.18 L/m²).

Note 2: Use higher application rate (0.12 to 0.18) within the minimum and maximum range under OGFC and PEM Mixes

- Allow standard anionic emulsified asphalt or cationic emulsified asphalt to break per emulsion manufacturer’s recommendation. Proceed with paving only after the anionic emulsified asphalt or cationic emulsified asphalt has cured to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
- Do not use anionic emulsified asphalt or cationic emulsified asphalt, other than CQS-Special Modified Asphalt Emulsion in conjunction with a spray paver, under OGFC or PEM on interstates or limited access state routes.

Note 1: Use higher application rate (0.22 to 0.28) within the minimum and maximum under OGFC and PEM Mixes

# B. Place Patching and Leveling Course

1. When the existing surface is irregular, bring the surface area to the proper cross section and grade with a leveling course of hot mix asphaltic concrete materials.
2. Place leveling at the locations and in the amounts directed by the Engineer.
3. Use leveling course mixtures meeting the requirements of the job mix formulas defined in:
- Subsection 400.3.05.A, Observe Composition of Mixtures
- Section 828
- Leveling acceptance schedules in Subsection 400.3.06.A, Acceptance Plans for Gradation and Asphalt Cement Content
4. If the leveling and patching mix type is undesignated, determine the mix type by the thickness or spread rate according to Table 3, but do not use 4.75 mm mix on interstate projects.
5. If patching is required to correct mat deficiencies in the final surface layer, ensure patches extend full lane width and no less than the length of the affected area as determined by the Engineer.

# Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# 2. Mixture control

Compose hot mix asphaltic concrete from a uniform mixture of aggregates, bituminous material, and if required, hydrated lime, mineral filler, or other approved additive. Ensure the constituents proportional to produce mixtures meeting the requirements in Section 828. The general composition limits prescribed are extreme ranges within which the job mix formula must be established. Base mixtures on a design analysis that meets the requirements of Section 828. Ensure the field performance of the in-place mixtures meet the requirements of Subsection 828.2B for Permeability, Moisture Susceptibility, Rutting Susceptibility and Fatigue. In-place mix may be evaluated for compliance with Subsection 828.2.B at the discretion of the State Bituminous Construction Engineer under the following conditions:

- Deviates greater than 10 percent on gradation for mixture control sieves from the approved Job Mix Formula based on Acceptance or Independent Samples.
- Deviates greater than 0.7 percent in asphalt cement content from the approved Job Mix Formula based on Acceptance or Independent Samples.
- The calculated mean pavement air voids result in an adjusted pay factor less than 0.80 or any single sub lot result in mean pavement air voids exceeding 10.5 percent.
- Mix produced not using an approved mix design and/or job mix formula.

Remove and replace any material determined to not meet the requirements established in Section 828.2.B at the Contractor’s expense. If control test results show the characteristic tested does not conform to the job mix formula control tolerances given in Section 828, take immediate action to ensure that the quality control methods are effective. Control the materials to ensure extreme variations do not occur. Maintain the gradation within the composition limits in Section 828.

# B. Prepare Bituminous Material

Uniformly heat the bituminous material to the temperature specified in the job mix formula with a tolerance of ± 20 °F (± 11 °C).

# C. Prepare the Aggregate

Prepare the aggregate as follows:

1. Heat the aggregate for the mixture and ensure a mix temperature within the limits of the job mix formula.
2. Do not contaminate the aggregate with fuel during heating.
3. Reduce the absorbed moisture in the aggregate until the asphalt does not separate from the aggregate in the prepared mixture. If this problem occurs, the Engineer will establish a maximum limit for moisture content in the aggregates. When this limit is established, maintain the moisture content below this limit.

# D. Prepare the Mixture

Proportion the mixture ingredients as necessary to meet the required job mix formula. Mix until a homogenous mixture is produced.

# 1. Add Mineral Filler

When mineral filler is used, introduce it in the proper proportions and as specified in Subsection 400.3.02.B.5, Mineral Filler Supply System.

---

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

2. Add Hydrated Lime

When hydrated lime is included in the mixture, add it at a rate specified in Section 828 and the job mix formula. Use methods and equipment for adding hydrated lime according to Subsection 400.3.02.B.6, Hydrated Lime Treatment System.

Add hydrated lime to the aggregate by using Method A or B as follows:

- Method A—Dry Form—Add hydrated lime in its dry form to the mixture as follows, according to the type of plant:
- a. Batch Type Asphalt Plant: Add hydrated lime to the mixture in the weigh hopper or as approved and directed by the Engineer.
- b. Continuous Plant Using Pugmill Mixer: Feed hydrated lime into the hot aggregate before it is introduced into the mixer to ensure dry mixing is complete before the bituminous material is added.
- Method B—Lime/Water Slurry—Add the required quantity of hydrated lime (based on dry weight) in lime/water slurry form to the aggregate. This solution consists of lime and water in concentrations as directed by the Engineer.

Equip the plant to blend and maintain the hydrated lime in suspension and to mix the hydrated lime with the aggregates uniformly in the proportions specified.

c. Continuous Plant Using Drier-Drum Mixer: Add hydrated lime so to ensure the lime will not become entrained into the air stream of the drier and to ensure thorough dry mixing will be complete before the bituminous material is added.

3. Add Stabilizing Fiber

When stabilizing fiber is included in the mixture, add stabilizing fiber at a rate specified in Section 819 and the Job Mix Formula. Introduce it as specified in Subsection 400.3.02.B.8, Fiber Supply System.

4. Add Gilsonite Modifier

When approved by the Office of Materials and Testing and required by the Contract, add the Gilsonite modifier to the mixture at a rate to ensure eight percent by weight of the asphalt cement is replaced by Gilsonite. Use either PG 64-22 or PG 67-22 asphalt cement as specified in Subsection 820.2.01. Provide suitable means to calibrate and check the rate of Gilsonite being added. Introduce Gilsonite modifier by either of the following methods.

- a. For batch type plants, incorporate Gilsonite into the pugmill at the beginning of the dry mixing cycle. Increase the dry mix cycle by a minimum of 10 seconds after the Gilsonite is added and prior to introduction of the asphalt cement. For this method, supply Gilsonite in plastic bags to protect the material during shipment and handling and store the modifier in a waterproof environment. Ensure the bags are capable of being completely melted and uniformly blended into the combined mixture. Gilsonite may also be added through a mineral filler supply system as described in Subsection 400.3.02.B.5, Mineral Filler Supply System. Ensure the system is capable of injecting the modifier into the weigh hopper near the center of the aggregate batching cycle so the material can be accurately weighed.
- b. For drier-drum plants, add Gilsonite through the recycle ring or through an acceptable means which will introduce the Gilsonite prior to the asphalt cement injection point. The modifier must proportionately feed into the drum mixer at the required rate by a proportioning device which shall be accurate within ± 10 percent of the amount required. Ensure the entry point is away from flames and the Gilsonite will not be caught up in the air stream and exhaust system.

5. Materials from Different Sources

Do not use mixtures prepared from aggregates from different sources intermittently. This will cause the color of the finished pavement to vary.

# Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# E. Observe Weather Limitations

Do not mix and place asphaltic concrete if the existing surface is wet or frozen. Do not lay asphaltic concrete OGFC mix or PEM at air temperatures below 60 ºF (16 ºC). When using a MTV, OGFC mix or PEM may be placed at 55 ºF (13 ºC) when approved by the Engineer. For other courses, follow the temperature guidelines in the following table:

| Lift Thickness                  | Minimum Temperature                                        |

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

1. Unload the mixture into the paver hopper or into a device designed to receive the mixture from delivery vehicles.
2. Except for leveling courses, spread the mixture to the loose depth for the compacted thickness or the spread rate. Use a mechanical spreader true to the line, grade, and cross section specified.
3. For leveling courses, use a motor grader equipped with a spreader box and smooth tires to spread the material or use a mechanical spreader meeting the requirements in Subsection 400.3.02.C, Equipment at Project Site.
4. Obtain the Engineer’s approval for the sequence of paving operations, including paving the adjoining lanes. Minimize tracking tack onto surrounding surfaces.
5. Ensure the outside edges of the pavement being laid are aligned and parallel to the roadway center line.
6. For New Construction or Resurfacing Contracts containing multiple lifts or courses, arrange the width of the individual lifts so the longitudinal joints of each successive lift are offset from the previous lift at least 1 ft. (300 mm). This requirement does not apply to the lift immediately over thin lift leveling courses.
7. Ensure the longitudinal joint(s) in the surface course and the mix immediately underneath asphaltic concrete OGFC or PEM are at the lane line(s).

NOTE: Perform night work with artificial light provided by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer.

Where mechanical equipment cannot be used, spread and rake the mixture by hand. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the operation sequence, including compactive methods, in these areas.
Keep small hand raking tools clean and free from asphalt build up. Do not use fuel oil or other harmful solvents to clean tools during the work.
Do not use mixture with any of these characteristics:
- Segregated
- Nonconforming temperature
- Deficient or excessive asphalt cement content
- Otherwise unsuitable to place on the roadway in the work

Remove and replace mixture placed on the roadway that the Engineer determines has unacceptable blemish levels from segregation, raveling, streaking, pulling and tearing, or other deficient characteristics. Replace with acceptable mixture at the Contractor’s expense. Do not continually place mixtures with deficiencies. Do not place subsequent course lifts over another lift or course while the temperature of the previously placed mix is 140 °F (60 °C) or greater.
Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the material compaction equipment. Perform the rolling as follows:

Begin the rolling as close behind the spreader as possible without causing excessive distortion of the asphaltic concrete surface.
Continue rolling until roller marks are no longer visible.
Use pneumatic-tired rollers with breakdown rollers on all courses except asphaltic concrete OGFC, PEM and SMA or other mixes designated by the Engineer.

If applicable, taper or “feather” asphaltic concrete from full depth to a depth no greater than 0.5 in. (13 mm) along curbs, gutters, raised pavement edges, and areas where drainage characteristics of the road must be retained. The Engineer will determine the location and extent of tapering.

# G. Maintain Continuity of Operations

Coordinate plant production, transportation, and paving operations to maintain a continuous operation. If the spreading operations are interrupted, construct a transverse joint if the mixture immediately behind the paver screed cools to less than 250 ºF (120 ºC).

# 3. Construction Joint Detail for OGFC and PEM Mixtures

In addition to meeting joint requirements described above, construct joints and transition areas for 12.5 mm OGFC and 12.5 mm PEM mixtures as follows:

1. For projects which do not have milling included as a pay item:
1. Place OGFC mixture meeting gradation requirements of 9.5 mm OGFC as specified in Section 828 on entrance and exit ramp gore areas and end of project construction joints.
- Taper mixture from 3/8 in. (10 mm) at end of project to full plan depth within maximum distance of spread for one load of mixture.
- Taper mixture placed on gore areas from thickness of the edge of the mainline to 3/8 in. (10 mm) at the point of the ramp transverse joint.
2. Construct the ramp transverse joint at the point specified in the plans or as directed by the Engineer.
3. Mixture placed in the transition and gore areas will be paid for at the contract unit price for 12.5 mm OGFC or 12.5 mm PEM, as applicable.
2. For projects which have milling included as a pay item:
1. Taper milling for a distance of no less than 50 ft. (15 m) to a depth of 2 1/4 in. (59 mm) at the point of the transverse joint.
2. Taper thickness, if needed, of the dense-graded surface mix within the 50 ft. (15 m) distance to 1 1/2 in. (40 mm) at the point of the transverse joint.
3. Taper thickness of the 12.5 mm OGFC or 12.5 mm PEM to 3/4 in. (19 mm) to ensure the material ties in at grade level with the existing surface at the point of the transverse joint.

# I. Protect the Pavement

Protect sections of the newly finished pavement from traffic until the traffic will not mar the surface or alter the surface texture. If directed by the Engineer, use artificial methods to cool the newly finished pavement to open the pavement to traffic more quickly.

# J. Modify the Job Mix Formula

If the Engineer determines that undesirable mixture or mat characteristics are being obtained, the job mix formula may require immediate adjustment.

# 400.3.06 Quality Acceptance

# A. Acceptance Plans for Gradation and Asphalt Cement Content

The Contractor will randomly sample and test mixtures for acceptance on a lot basis. The Department will monitor the Contractor testing program and perform comparison and quality assurance testing. The Contractor’s Quality Control Technicians shall participate in the Department’s Independent Assurance Systems Basis Program.

# 1. Determine Lot Amount

A lot consists of the tons (megagrams) of asphaltic concrete produced and placed each production day. If this production is less than 500 tons (500 Mg), or its square yard (meter) equivalent, production may be incorporated into the next working day. The Engineer may terminate a lot when a pay adjustment is imminent if a plant or materials adjustment resulting in a probable correction has been made. Terminate all open lots at the end of the month, except for materials produced and placed during the adjustment period. The lot will be terminated as described in Subsection 400.5.01, Adjustments. If the final day’s production does not constitute a lot, the production may be included in the lot for the previous day’s run; or, the Engineer may treat the production as a separate lot with a corresponding lower number of tests.

# 2. Determine Lot Acceptance

Determine lot acceptance as found in Subsection 400.5.01, Adjustments. The Department will perform the following task: Determine the pay factor by using the mean of the deviations from the job mix formula of the tests in each lot and apply it to Table 10 Mixture Acceptance Schedule for Surface Mixes or Table 11 Mixture Acceptance Schedule for Subsurface Mixes, whichever is appropriate. This mean will be determined by averaging the actual numeric value of the individual deviations from the job mix formula, disregarding whether the deviations are positive or negative amounts. Do not calculate lot acceptance using test results for materials not used in the Work. Determine the pay factor for each lot by multiplying the contract unit price by the appropriate pay factor from the Mixture Acceptance Schedule - Table 10 or Table 11. When two or more pay factors for a specific lot are less than 1.0, determine the adjusted payment by multiplying the contract unit price by the lowest pay factor. If the mean of the deviations from the job mix formula of the lot acceptance tests for a control sieve or for asphalt cement content exceeds the tolerances established in the appropriate Mixture Acceptance Schedule, and if the Engineer determines that the material need not be removed and replaced, the lot may be accepted at an adjusted unit price as determined by the Engineer. If the Engineer determines that the material is not acceptable to leave in place, the materials shall be removed and replaced at the Contractor's expense.

# 3. Provide Quality Control Program

Provide a Quality Control Program as established in SOP 27 which includes:

- Assignment of quality control responsibilities to specifically named individuals who have been certified by the Office of Materials and Testing
- Provisions for prompt implementation of control and corrective measures
- Provisions for communication with Project Manager, Bituminous Technical Services Engineer, and Testing Management Operations Supervisor at all times
- Provisions for reporting all test results daily through the Office of Materials and Testing computerized Field Data Collection System, AASHTO Trns*port SiteManager, or approved computerized application; other checks, calibrations and records will be reported on a form developed by the Contractor and will be included as part of the project records
- Notification in writing of any change in quality control personnel

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

a. Certification Requirements:

- Use laboratory and testing equipment certified by the Department. (Laboratories which participate in and maintain AASHTO accreditation for testing asphaltic concrete mixtures will be acceptable in lieu of Departmental certification.)
- Provide certified quality control personnel to perform the sampling and testing. A Quality Control Technician (QCT) may be certified at three levels:
- 1. Temporary Certification – must be a technician trainee who shall be given direct oversight by a certified Level 1 or Level 2 QCT while performing acceptance testing duties during the first 5 days of training. The trainee must complete qualification requirements within 30 Georgia Department of Transportation funded production days after being granted temporary certification. A trainee who does not become qualified within 30 Georgia Department of Transportation funded production days will not be re-eligible for temporary certification. A certified Level 1 or Level 2 QCT shall be at the plant at all times during production and shipment of mixture to monitor work of the temporarily certified technician.
2. Level 1 – must demonstrate they are competent in performing the process control and acceptance tests and procedures related to hot mix asphalt production and successfully pass a written exam.
3. Level 2 – must meet Level 1 requirements and must be capable of and responsible for making process control adjustments, and successfully pass a written exam.

Technician certification is valid for 3 years from the date on the technician’s certificate unless revoked or suspended. Eligible technicians may become certified through special training and testing approved by the Office of Materials and Testing. Technicians who lose their certification due to falsification of test data will not be eligible for recertification in the future unless approved by the State Materials and Testing Engineer.

b. Quality Control Management

1. Designate at least one Level 2 QCT as manager of the quality control operation. Ensure the Quality Control Manager meets the following requirements:
- Be accountable for actions of other QCT personnel.
- Ensure all applicable sampling requirements and frequencies, test procedures, and Standard Operating Procedures are followed.
- Ensure all reports, charts, and other documentation are completed as required.
2. Provide QCT personnel at the plant as follows:
- If daily production for all mix types is to be greater than 250 tons (megagrams), have a QCT person at the plant at all times during production and shipment of mixture until all required acceptance tests have been completed.
- If daily production for all mix types will not be greater than 250 tons (megagrams), a QCT may be responsible for conducting tests at up to two plants, subject to random number sample selection.
- Have available at the plant, or within immediate contact by phone or radio, a Level 2 QCT responsible for making prompt process control adjustments as necessary to correct the mix.

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

3) Sampling, Testing, and Inspection Requirements.

- a. Provide all sample containers, extractants, forms, diaries, and other supplies subject to approval of the Engineer.
- b. Perform daily sampling, testing, and inspection of mixture production that meet the following requirements:

1. Randomly sample mixtures according to GSP 15 and GDT 73 (Method C) and test on a lot basis. In the event less than the specified number of samples are taken, obtain representative 6 in. (150 mm) cores from the roadway at a location where the load not sampled was placed. Take enough cores to ensure minimum sample size requirements are met for each sample needed.
2. Maintain a printed copy of the computer-generated random sampling data as a part of the project records.
3. Perform sampling, testing, and inspection duties of GSP 21.
4. Perform extraction or ignition test (GDT 83 or GDT 125) and extraction analysis (GDT 38). If the ignition oven is used, a printout of sample data including weights becomes a part of the project records. For asphalt cement content only, digital printouts of liquid asphalt cement weights may be substituted in lieu of an extraction test for plants with digital recorders. Calculate the asphalt content from the ticket representing the mixture tested for gradation.
5. Save extracted aggregate, opposite quarters, and remaining material (for possible referee testing) of each sample as follows:
- • Store in properly labeled, suitable containers.
- • Secure in a protected environment.
- • Store for three working days. If not obtained by the Department within three days, they may be discarded in accordance with GSP 21.
6. Add the following information on load tickets from which a sample or temperature check is taken:
- • Mixture temperature
- • Signature of the QCT person performing the testing
7. Calibrate the lime system when hydrated lime is included in the mixture:
- • Perform a minimum of twice weekly during production
- • Post results at the plant for review.
- • Provide records of materials invoices upon request (including asphalt cement, aggregate, hydrated lime, etc.).

# Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

1. Take action if acceptance test results are outside Mixture Control Tolerances of Section 828.
- One sample out of tolerance
1. Contact Level 2 - QCT to determine if a plant adjustment is needed.
2. Immediately run a process control sample. Make immediate plant adjustments if this sample is also out of tolerance.
3. Test additional process control samples as needed to ensure corrective action taken appropriately controls the mixture.
- Two consecutive acceptance samples of the same mix type out of tolerance regardless of Lot or mix design level, or three consecutive acceptance samples out of tolerance regardless of mix type.
1. Stop plant production immediately.
2. Reject any mixture in storage:
- Deviating more than 10 percent in gradation from the job mix formula based on the acceptance sample.
- Deviating more than 0.7 percent in asphalt content from the job mix formula based on the acceptance sample.
3. Make a plant correction to any mix type out of tolerance prior to resuming production.
- Do not send any mixture to the project before test results of a process control sample meets Mixture Control Tolerances.
- Reject any mixture produced at initial restarting that does not meet Mixture Control Tolerances.

NOTE: Determine mixture temperature at least once per hour of production for OGFC and PEM mixes.

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# 4) Comparison Testing and Quality Assurance Program

a. Periodic comparison testing by the Department will be required of each QCT to monitor consistency of equipment and test procedures. The Department will take independent samples to monitor the Contractor's quality control program.

# 1) Comparison Sampling and Testing

Retain samples for comparison testing and referee testing if needed as described in Subsection 400.3.06.A.3.b.3. Discard these samples only if the Contractor's acceptance test results meet a 1.00 pay factor and the Department does not procure the samples within three working days. The Department will test comparison samples on a random basis. Results will be compared to the respective contractor acceptance tests, and the maximum difference is as follows:

| Sieve Size        | Surface | Sub-surface |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1/2 in. (12.5 mm) |         | 4.0%        |
| 3/8 in. (9.5 mm)  | 3.5%    | 4.0%        |
| No. 4 (4.75 mm)   | 3.5%    | 3.5%        |
| No. 8 (2.36 mm)   | 2.5%    | 3.0%        |
| No. 200 (75 μm)   | 2.0%    | 2.0%        |
| A.C.              | 0.4%    | 0.5%        |

1) If test comparisons are within these tolerances:

- Continue production
- Use the Contractor's tests for acceptance of the lot

2) If test comparisons are not within these tolerances:

- Another Departmental technician will test the corresponding referee sample.
- Results of the referee sample will be compared to the respective contractor and Departmental tests using the tolerance for comparison samples given above.

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# b. Independent Verification Sampling and Testing

1. Randomly take a minimum of two independent samples from the lesser of five days or five lots of production regardless of mix type or number of projects.
2. Compare test deviation from job mix formula to Mixture Control Tolerances in Section 828. If results are outside these tolerances, another sample from the respective mix may be taken. If test results of the additional sample are not within Mixture Control Tolerances, the Department will take the following action:
- Take random samples from throughout the subject lot(s) as established in Subsection 400.3.06.A.3.b.3 and use these test results for acceptance and in calculations for the monthly plant rating. Applicable pay factors will apply and the contractor QCT test results will not be included in pay factor calculations nor in the monthly plant rating.
- Determine if the Contractor's quality control program is satisfactory and require prompt corrective action by the Contractor if specification requirements are not being met.
- Determine if the QCT has not followed Departmental procedures or has provided erroneous information.
- Take samples of any in-place mixture represented by unacceptable QCT tests and use the additional sample results for acceptance and in calculations for the monthly plant rating and apply applicable pay factors. The Contractor QCT tests will not be included in the pay factor calculations nor in the monthly plant rating.

NOTE: For leveling or dense graded surface courses less than 110 lb./yd² (60 kg/m²) having quality assurance test results outside the Mixture Control Tolerances of Section 828, use the Department's test results only and applicable pay factors will apply.

# B. Compaction

Determine the mixture compaction using either GDT 39, GDT 59, or AASHTO T 331. The method of GDT 39 for “Uncoated Specimens, Dense Graded Mixtures Only” shall not apply when the water absorption of a sample exceeds 2.0 percent, as measured according to AASHTO T 166. In this case, either AASHTO T 331 or the paraffin method of GDT 39 shall apply. The compaction is accepted in lots defined in Subsection 400.3.06. A, Acceptance Plans for Gradation and Asphalt Cement Content and is within the same lot boundaries as the mixture acceptance.

1. Calculate Pavement Mean Air Voids
The Department is responsible for pavement mean air void acceptance testing. The Contractor is responsible for establishing all roller patterns and any quality control testing. Upon written request by the Contractor, the Office of Materials and Testing will provide nuclear gauge testing assistance for compaction related issues. The Department will calculate the pavement air voids placed within each lot as follows:

1. One test per sub-lot.
- Lots > 400 ton (400 Mg) of mix are divided into 5 sub-lots of equal distance.
- Lots ≤ 400 tons (400 Mg) of mix are divided into a sub-lot or sub-lots of equal distance at a rate of one per 100 tons (100 Mg) mix each (Example: 299 tons of mix require 3 sublots and 301 tons of mix require 4 sublots). There will be less than 5 sub-lots.
2. Average the results of all tests run on randomly selected sites in that lot.
3. Select representative sites randomly using GDT 73.
Density tests are not required for asphaltic concrete placed at 90 lbs./yd2 (50 kg/m2) or less, 4.75 mm mix, asphaltic concrete OGFC, PEM, and mixes placed as variable depth or width leveling. Compact these courses to the Engineer’s satisfaction. Density tests will not be performed on turn-outs and driveways.

---

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

The targeted maximum Pavement Mean Air Void content for all Superpave and Stone Matrix Asphalt mixtures is 5.0 percent. Ensure that the maximum Pavement Mean Air Voids for all Superpave and Stone Matrix Asphalt mixtures does not exceed 7.0 percent. The maximum Pavement Mean Air Voids for 2 ft. shoulder widening is 9.0 percent. The adjustment period for density is four lots or four production days, whichever is less, in order for the contractor to ensure maximum compactive effort has been achieved, which will yield no more than the specified maximum allowed Mean Air Voids. One additional lot or production day of adjustment may be given for a reduction in asphalt cement content on the JMF made by the Office of Materials and Testing for mix designs incorporating the Corrected Optimum Asphalt Content COAC.

If the contractor needs to adjust the mixture to improve density results, a change in the job mix formula may be requested for approval during the adjustment period so long as the following values are not exceeded:

- Coarse pay sieve          ± 4%
- No. 8 (2.36 mm) sieve     ± 2%
- No. 200 (75 μm) sieve     ± 1%
- Asphalt Content           ± 0.2%
- All value changes must still be within specification limits.

If the Office of Materials and Testing is satisfied that the contractor has exerted the maximum compactive effort and is not able to maintain Pavement Mean Air Voids at no more than 7.0%, the Engineer may establish a maximum target for Pavement Mean Air Voids.

Ensure mixture placed during the adjustment period for density meets the requirements for a 0.90 pay factor in Table 13 of Subsection 400.5.01.C, Calculate Mean Pavement Air Voids. Mixture not meeting these density requirements is paid for using the applicable pay factor.

If the mean air voids of the pavement placed within a lot exceeds 100% of the maximum target air voids, if established, and the Engineer determines that the material need not be removed and replaced, the lot may be accepted at an adjusted unit price as determined by the Engineer.

# 2. Obtain Uniform Compaction

For a lot to receive a pay factor of 1.00 for compaction acceptance, the air void range cannot exceed 5 percent for new construction or resurfacing projects. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest acceptance test results within the affected lot. If the air void range exceeds these tolerances, apply a Pay Factor of 95%.

The 5% reduced pay factor for the compaction range does not apply in these instances:

- The mixture is placed during the adjustment period as defined in Subsection 400.5.01.A, Materials Produced and Placed During the Adjustment Period.
- All air void results within a given lot are less than 7.0%.
- A lot containing two sublot or less.
- On two foot trench widening.
- For sub-surfaces mixes including 19 mm and 25 mm Superpave mixes if all air void results within a given lot are >2.5 % &#x3C;8 %.

When lots are reevaluated for range penalty, as shown in Subsection 106.03, Samples, Tests, Cited Specifications, sampling and testing is according to GDT 73. Request for reevaluation must be made within 5 working days of notification of the lot results. The following procedures apply:

The Department will reevaluate the lot through additional testing by obtaining and testing three additional cores acquired in representative sites selected randomly throughout each sub-lot representing the high and low in-place air voids as detailed in GDT 73. The additional six cores (three cores from each sub-lot will be averaged) will replace the original five core results for range specified requirements only. The original five cores’ results will be reported for Pavement Mean Air Voids for the lot. This will be the final evaluation for compaction range for the lot. Lots will not be re-evaluated for range when the Pavement Mean Air Voids result in a lower than 95% pay factor. Ensure requests for reevaluation are made within 5 working days of notification of the lot results.



---


Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

The Department will determine the payment for each lot by multiplying the Contract Unit Price by the adjusted pay factor shown in the Table 7 Average Air Voids Range Acceptance Schedule:

| Pay Factor       | Range between High and Low Air Void | Re-evaluated Range between High and Low Air Void Cores | New Cores obtained from High (3 cores) and Low location (3 cores) |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Original 5 cores | 100                                 | ≤ 5 %                                                  | < 4.50 %                                                          |
|                  | 0.95                                | > 5 %                                                  | > 4.50 %                                                          |

# C. Surface Tolerance

In this specification, pavement courses to be overlaid with an OGFC or PEM are considered surface courses. All OGFC or PEM are to be evaluated after the roadway has been opened to traffic for a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 15 days. Asphaltic Concrete paving is subject to straightedge and visual inspection and irregularity correction as shown below:

# 1. Visual and Straightedge Inspection

Paving is subject to visual and straightedge inspection during and after construction operations until Final Acceptance. Locate surface irregularities as follows:

- Keep a 10 ft. (3 m) straightedge near the paving operation to measure surface irregularities on courses. Provide the straightedge and the labor for its use.
- Inspect the base, intermediate, and surface course surfaces with the straightedge to detect irregularities.
- Correct irregularities that exceed 3/16 in. in 10 ft. (5 mm in 3 m) for base and intermediate courses and surface courses.

Mixture or operating techniques will be stopped if irregularities such as rippling, tearing, or pulling occur and the Engineer suspects a continuing equipment problem. Stop the paving operation and correct the problem. Correct surface course evaluations on individual Laser Road Profiler test sections, normally 1 mile (1 km) long.

# 2. Target Surface Profile Smoothness

The Department will use the Laser Road Profiler method to conduct acceptance testing for surface course tolerance according to GDT 126. This testing will be performed only on:

- Surface courses on Projects with mainline traveled way measuring a minimum distance of 1 mile (1600 m)
- Ramps more than 0.5 mile (800 m) long

Combine partial sections measuring less than 0.5 mile (800 m) with the previous full mile for acceptance.

# 3. Bridge Approach Profile Smoothness Quality

The following are subject to a ride quality test of roadway approaching each end of a bridge using the Laser Road Profiler, Rainhart Profiler or Lightweight Profiler:

- A state route with 4 lanes or more
- A 2-lane state route with a current traffic count two-way ADT 2,000 vpd or more
- Locations designated on the plans

All other bridge approaches not meeting the above criteria shall meet the 3/16 in. in 10 ft. (5 mm in 3 m) straightedge requirement. When the distance between the ends of two bridges, the end of a bridge and an intersection, or the end of a bridge and a vertical or horizontal curve is less than 540 ft. (165 m) and locations where the testing vehicle cannot maintain minimum testing speed while taking profile measurements will not be tested and will be subject to straightedge requirements.

The bridge approaches will meet the straightedge requirements.

Test ride quality as follows:

# For Resurfacing Projects:

1. The Department will determine a profile smoothness index value using the laser road profiler in accordance with test method GDT 126.
2. The Department will determine the Half Car Simulation (HCS) IRI for each HMA asphalt 1/10ᵗʰ of mile (0.16 km) segments adjacent to each approach slab joint for each lane. The HCS IRI will be reported in 1/20ᵗʰ of mile (0.08 km) segment readings that will be averaged to calculate the final 1/10-mile section, in accordance with GDT 126.
- Correct individual bumps or depression exceeding 3/16 in. in 10 ft. (3 mm in 3 m) straightedge requirement as directed by the Engineer.
- Ensure the profile smoothness index shows an improvement over pre-construction profile smoothness or meets a profile smoothness index of ≤ 1025 mm/km (66 inches/mile) for the average 1/10 mile (0.16 km).
3. Ensure Resurfacing projects meet the profile smoothness index improvement requirement for the specified 1/10ᵗʰ mile (0.16 km) segment of roadway up to the bridge approach/exit slab joint. In accordance with Section 106.3.A.3, the Contractor may request reevaluation(s) for Laser Road Profiler Test results on Resurfacing Bridge Projects and straightedge measurement(s) on either that fail to meet specified requirements. Request for reevaluation shall be made to the Engineer within 5 working days of notification of failing results. At the Engineer’s approval, reevaluation of failing results using the Lightweight Profiler Test, Laser Road Profiler Test and straightedge measurement(s) shall be conducted in conjunction with representatives from the Office of Materials and Testing in accordance with GDT 126 or GDT 134, whichever is applicable. The Department will perform ride quality testing up to two times on the bridge approaches/exits at no cost to the Contractor. For these reevaluations, evaluation of the bridge exit end may be taken testing towards the bridge against traffic if the contractor provides traffic control, at the contractors’ expense, upon request.

# For All New Construction Projects:

1. The Department will determine a profile index value according to test method GDT 78 or GDT 134.
2. The Department will average the profile index value from the right and left wheelpath for each 100 ft. (30 m) section for each lane.
- Keep the profile index value under 30 in/mile (475 mm/km), correct individual bumps or depressions exceeding 0.2 in. (5 mm) from blanking band on the profilograph trace.
3. Ensure New Construction projects meet the profile index value for the specified 100 ft. (30 m) section of roadway up to the bridge joint.
4. Schedule the ride quality testing on All New Construction projects 5 days before needed by contacting the Office of Materials and Testing. Clean and clear obstructions from the test area.

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

Correct the sections that do not meet the ride quality criteria of this specification. After correction, these sections are subject to retesting with the Lightweight Profiler. The Engineer will direct the type of correction method, which may include:

- Milling
- Grinding
- Removing and replacing the roadway

No additional compensation will be made.

In accordance with Section 106.3.A.3, the Contractor may request reevaluation(s) for Lightweight Profiler Test results on newly constructed bridge projects, Laser Road Profiler Test results on resurfacing bridge projects and straightedge measurement(s) on either that fail to meet specified requirements. Request for reevaluation shall be made to the Engineer within 5 working days of notification of failing results. At the Engineer’s approval, reevaluation of failing results using the Lightweight Profiler Test, Laser Road Profiler Test and straightedge measurement(s) shall be conducted by representatives from the Office of Materials and Testing in accordance with GDT 134.

The Department will perform ride quality testing up to two times on the bridge approaches at no cost to the Contractor. Additional testing will be charged to the Contractor in accordance with Section 500.5.01.B.

# 4. Surface Smoothness Acceptance

When recommended by the Office of Materials and Testing, a pay reduction may be accepted in lieu of correction for roadways and bridge approaches that fail to achieve specified smoothness indexes in accordance with SOP 46 “Procedure for Calculating Pay Reduction for Failing Roadway and Bridge Approach Smoothness.” The Office of Materials and Testing may recommend a waiver of profile smoothness requirements when improvement over pre-construction smoothness profile exceeds 25 percent for urban roadways, as defined in Table 9.

# D. Reevaluation of Lots

When lots are reevaluated as shown in Subsection 106.03, Samples, Tests, Cited Specifications, sampling and testing is according to GDT 73. Ensure request for reevaluation are made within 5 working days of notification of the lot results. The following procedures apply:

1. For asphaltic concrete mixtures other than OGFC and PEM mix types, thin lift courses &#x3C; 110 lbs./yd² and mixture paid for as patching, the Department will take the same number of new tests using cores taken at randomly selected locations in accordance GDT 73. The Department will use only these test results for gradation and AC content obtained using these cores for acceptance. For OGFC and PEM mix types, thin lift courses &#x3C; 110 lbs./yd² and mixture paid for as patching, the retained opposite quarter shall be used for mixture acceptance reevaluation when requested by the Contractor. The Department will use the absolute average deviations from the job mix formula for these tests to determine acceptance based on the appropriate column in the Asphalt Cement Content and Aggregate Gradation of Asphalt Concrete Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 or 11.
2. Compaction Acceptance
The Department will reevaluate the lot through additional testing by cutting the same number of cores originally obtained and averaging these results with the results from the original density tests. The Department will use the average to determine acceptance according to the Compaction Acceptance Schedule in Subsection 400.5.01.C, Calculate Pavement Mean Air Voids.

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# E. Segregated Mixture

Prevent mixture placement yielding a segregated mat by following production, storage, loading, placing, and handling procedures. Ensure needed plant modifications and provide necessary auxiliary equipment. (See Subsection 400.1.01, Definitions.)

If the mixture is segregated in the finished mat, the Department will take actions based on the degree of segregation. The actions are described below.

# 1. Unquestionably Unacceptable Segregation

When the Engineer determines the segregation in the finished mat is unquestionably unacceptable, follow these measures:

1. Suspend Work and require the Contractor to take positive corrective action. The Department will evaluate the segregated areas to determine the extent of the corrective work to the in-place mat as follows:

- Perform extraction and gradation analysis by taking 6 in. (150 mm) cores from typical, visually unacceptable segregated areas.
- Determine the corrective work according to Subsection 400.3.06.E.3.
2. Require the Contractor to submit a written plan of measures and actions to prevent further segregation. Work will not continue until the plan is submitted to and approved by the Department.
3. When work resumes, place a test section not to exceed 500 tons (500 Mg) of the affected mixture for the Department to evaluate. If a few loads show that corrective actions were not adequate, follow the measures above beginning with step 1.a. above. If the problem is solved, work may continue.

# 2. Unacceptable Segregation Suspected

When the Engineer observes segregation in the finished mat and the work may be unacceptable, follow these measures:

1. Allow work to continue at Contractor’s risk.
2. Require Contractor to immediately and continually adjust operation until the visually apparent segregated areas are eliminated from the finished mat. The Department will immediately investigate to determine the severity of the apparent segregation as follows:

# 3. Corrective Work

1. Remove and replace (at the Contractor’s expense) any segregated area where the gradation on the control sieves is found to vary 10 percent or more from the approved job mix formula, the asphalt cement varies 1.0% or more from the approved job mix formula, or if in-place air voids exceed 13.5% based on GDT 39. The control sieves for each mix type are shown in Subsection 400.5.01.B Determine Lot Acceptance.
2. Subsurface mixes. For subsurface mixes, limit removal and replacement to the full lane width and no less than 10 ft. (3 m) long and as approved by the Engineer.
3. Surface Mixes. For surface mixes, ensure that removal and replacement is not less than the full width of the affected lane and no less than the length of the affected areas as determined by the Engineer.
4. Surface tolerance requirements apply to the corrected areas for both subsurface and surface mixes.

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# 400.3.07 Contractor Warranty and Maintenance

A. Contractor’s Record

- Maintain a dated, written record of the most recent plant calibration. Keep this record available for the Engineer’s inspection at all times. Maintain records in the form of:

# 400.4 Measurement

Thickness and spread rate tolerances for the various mixtures are specified in Subsection 400.4.A.2.b, Table 12, Thickness and Spread Rate Tolerance at Any Given Location. These tolerances are applied as outlined below:

# A. Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Paid for by Weight

# 1. Plans Designate a Spread Rate

a. Thickness Determinations. Thickness determinations are not required when the plans designate a spread rate per square yard (meter). If the spread rate exceeds the upper limits outlined in the Subsection 400.4.A.2.b, Table 12, Thickness and Spread Rate Tolerance at Any Given Location, the mix in excess will not be paid for. If the rate of spread is less than the lower limit, correct the deficient course by overlaying the entire lot. The mixture used for correcting deficient areas is paid for at the Contract Unit Price of the course being corrected and is subject to the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 or 11.

b. Recalculate the Total Spread Rate. After the deficient hot mix course has been corrected, the total spread rate for that lot is recalculated, and mix in excess of the upper tolerance limit as outlined in the Subsection 400.4.A.2.b, Table 12, Thickness and Spread Rate Tolerance at Any Given Location is not paid for. The quantity of material placed on irregular areas such as driveways, turnouts, intersections, feather edge section, etc., is deducted from the final spread determination for each lot.

# 2. Plans Designate Thickness

If the average thickness exceeds the tolerances specified in the Subsection 400.4.A.2.b, Table 12, Thickness and Spread Rate Tolerance at Any Given Location, the Engineer shall take cores to determine the area of excess thickness. Excess quantity will not be paid for. If the average thickness is deficient by more than the tolerances specified in the Thickness and Spread Rate Tolerance at Any Given Location table below, the Engineer shall take additional cores to determine the area of deficient thickness. Correct areas with thickness deficiencies as follows:

- a. Overlay the deficient area with the same mixture type being corrected or with an approved surface mixture. The overlay shall extend for a minimum of 300 ft. (90 m) for the full width of the course.
- b. Ensure that the corrected surface course complies with Subsection 400.3.06.C.1, Visual and Straightedge Inspection. The mixture required to correct a deficient area is paid for at the Contract Unit Price of the course being corrected. The mixture is subject to the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 or 11. The quantity of the additional mixture shall not exceed the required calculated quantity used to increase the average thickness of the overlaid section to the maximum tolerance allowed under the following table.



---

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

# TABLE 12—THICKNESS AND SPREAD RATE TOLERANCE AT ANY GIVEN LOCATION

| Course                                | Thickness Specified | Spread Rate Specified      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Asphaltic concrete base course        | ± 0.5 in. (± 13 mm) | ± 55 lbs./yd² (30 kg/m²)   |
| Intermediate and/or wearing course    | ± 0.25 in. (± 6 mm) | ± 27.5 lbs./yd² (15 kg/m²) |
| Overall of any combination of 1 and 2 | ± 0.5 in. (± 13 mm) | ± 55 lbs./yd² (30 kg/m²)   |

Note: For asphaltic concrete 9.5 mm OGFC and 12.5 mm OGFC, control the spread rate per lot within 7 lbs./yd² (4 kg/m²) of the designated spread rate. For asphaltic concrete 12.5 mm PEM, control the spread rate per lot within 10 lbs./yd² (6 kg/m²) of the designated spread rate.

Note: Thickness and spread rate tolerances are provided to allow normal variations within a given lot. Do not continuously operate at a thickness of spread rate not specified.

When the plans specify a thickness, the Engineer may take as many cores as necessary to determine the average thickness of the intermediate or surface course. The Engineer shall take a minimum of one core per 1,000 ft. (300 m) per two lanes of roadway. Thickness will be determined by average measurements of each core according to GDT 42.

If the average exceeds the tolerances specified in the Subsection 400.4.A.2.b, Table 12, Thickness and Spread Rate Tolerance at Any Given Location, additional cores will be taken to determine the area of excess thickness and excess tonnage will not be paid for.

# B. Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Paid for by Square Yard (Meter)

1. The thickness of the base course or the intermediate or surface course will be determined by the Department by cutting cores and the thickness will be determined by averaging the measurements of each core.
2. If any measurement is deficient in thickness more than the tolerances given in the table above, additional cores will be taken by the Department to determine the area of thickness deficiency. Correct thickness deficiency areas as follows:
1. Overlay the deficient area with the same type mixtures being corrected or with surface mixture. Extend the overlay at least 300 ft. (90 m) for the full width of the course.
2. Ensure the corrected surface course complies with Subsection 400.3.06.C.1, Visual and Straightedge Inspection.
3. The mixture is subject to the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 or 11.
3. No extra payment is made for mixtures used for correction.
4. No extra payment is made for thickness in excess of that specified.

# C. Asphaltic Concrete

Hot mix asphaltic concrete, complete in place and accepted, is measured in tons (megagrams) or square yards (meters) as indicated in the Proposal. If payment is by the ton (megagram), the actual weight is determined by weighing each loaded vehicle on the required motor truck scale as the material is hauled to the roadway, or by using recorded weights if a digital recording device is used.

The weight measured includes all materials. No deductions are made for the weight of the individual ingredients. The actual weight is the pay weight except when the aggregates used have a combined bulk specific gravity greater than 2.75. In this case the pay weight is determined according to the following formula:



---

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

% Aggregate x 2.75

T1 = T x % AC + + % Y

combined bulk Specific Gravity

100

Where:

- T1 Pay weight, tonnage (Mg)
- T= Actual weight
- % AC= Percent asphalt cement by weight of total mixture
- % Aggregate = Percent aggregate by weight of total mixture minus the hydrated lime
- Combined Bulk Sp. Gr.= Calculated combined bulk specific gravity of various mineral aggregates used in the mixture
- % Y= Percent hydrated lime by weight of mineral aggregate

# D. Bituminous Material

Bituminous material is not measured for separate payment.

# E. Hydrated Lime

When hydrated lime is used as an anti-stripping additive, it is not measured for separate payment.

# F. Field Laboratory

The field laboratory required in this specification is not measured for separate payment.

# G. Asphaltic Concrete Leveling

Payment of hot mix asphaltic concrete leveling, regardless of the type mix, is full compensation for furnishing materials, bituminous materials, and hydrated lime (when required) for patching and repair of minor defects, surface preparation, cleaning, hauling, mixing, spreading, and rolling. Mixture for leveling courses is subject to the acceptance schedule as stated in Subsection 400.3.06.A and Subsection 400.3.06.B.

# H. Asphaltic Concrete Patching

Hot mix asphaltic concrete patching, regardless of the type mix, is paid for at the Contract Unit Price per ton (Megagram), complete in place and accepted. Payment is full compensation for:

- Furnishing materials such as bituminous material and hydrated lime (when required)
- Preparing surface to be patched
- Cutting areas to be patched, trimmed, and cleaned
- Hauling, mixing, placing, and compacting the materials

When mixture for patching is paid for by the Department, ensure the mixture is subject to the acceptance schedule as stated in Subsection 400.3.06.A.

# 400.4.01 Limits

When the asphaltic concrete is paid for by the square yard (meter) and multiple lifts are used, the number and thickness of the lifts are subject to the Engineer’s approval and are used to prorate the pay factor for the affected roadway section.

# 400.5 Payment

When materials or construction are not within the tolerances in this specification, the Contract Price will be adjusted according to Subsection 106.03, Samples, Tests, Cited Specifications and Subsection 400.3.06, Quality Acceptance. Hot mix asphaltic concrete of the various types are paid for at the Contract Unit Price per ton (megagram) or per square yard (meter). Payment is full compensation for furnishing and placing materials including asphalt cement, hydrated lime when required, approved additives, and for cleaning and repairing, preparing surfaces, hauling, mixing, spreading, rolling, and performing other operations to complete the Contract Item.

# 400.5.01 Adjustments

A. Materials Produced and Placed During the Adjustment Period

An adjustment period is allowed at the start of mixing operations for each type of mix placed on the Contract. Asphaltic Concrete OGFC or PEM shall be granted an adjustment period for the first 500 tons (500 Mg) produced for the Contract. A new adjustment period shall not be granted for a change of producer, mix design or asphalt plant location. The adjustment period is provided to adjust or correct the mix and to establish the construction procedures and sequence of operations.

The adjustment period consists of the tons (megagrams) of the affected mix produced and placed on the first day of operation. If this quantity is less than 500 tons (500 Mg), the Engineer may combine the tons (megagrams) produced and placed on the first day of operation with the tons (megagrams) produced and placed on the next production day of the affected mix for the adjustment period.

The material produced and placed during the mixture adjustment period is one lot. If the mix is adjusted during this period, a new lot may be necessary, but a new adjustment period will not be permitted.

# Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

This material shall be paid for at 100 percent of the Contract Unit Price provided it meets the minimum requirements for a 1.00 pay factor for asphalt cement content and a 0.90 pay factor for gradation in the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 or 11. If the material placed during the adjustment period fails to meet the above requirements, it will be paid for using the applicable acceptance schedule. However, when mixture used for leveling at a spread rate of 90 lbs./yd² (50 kg/m²) or less is also used for the surface mix at a spread rate greater than 90 lbs./yd² (50 kg/m²), an additional adjustment period will be allowed for compaction only. This material will be paid for at a 1.00 pay factor provided it:

- Meets the minimum requirements for a 1.00 pay factor in the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 or 11 for both asphalt content and gradation.
- Meets the minimum requirements for a 0.90 pay factor in Table 13 of Subsection 400.5.01C, Calculate Mean Pavement Air Voids.

Mixture which does not meet these requirements shall be paid for using the applicable acceptance schedule.

# B. Determine Lot Acceptance

Pay factor adjustments are based on control sieves and asphalt cement content. The control sieves used in the mixture acceptance schedule for the various types of mix are indicated below:

| Asphaltic concrete 25 mm Superpave   | 1/2 in., No. 8 (12.5 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Asphaltic concrete 19 mm SMA         | 1/2 in., No. 8 (12.5 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement |
| Asphaltic concrete 19 mm Superpave   | 3/8 in., No. 8 (9.5 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement  |
| Asphaltic concrete 12.5 mm Superpave | 3/8 in., No. 8 (9.5 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement  |
| Asphaltic concrete 12.5 mm SMA       | 3/8 in., No. 8 (9.5 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement  |
| Asphaltic concrete 12.5 mm PEM       | 3/8 in., No. 8 (9.5 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement  |
| Asphaltic concrete 12.5 mm OGFC      | 3/8 in., No. 8 (9.5 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement  |
| Asphaltic concrete 9.5 mm Superpave  | No. 4, No. 8 (4.75 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement   |
| Asphaltic concrete 9.5 mm SMA        | No. 4, No. 8 (4.75 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement   |
| concrete 9.5 mm OGFC                 | No. 4, No. 8 (4.75 mm, 2.36 mm) sieves and asphalt cement   |
| Asphaltic concrete 4.75 mm Mix       | No. 8 (2.36 mm) sieve and asphalt cement                    |

For projects which do not have milling quantities established as a Pay Item, the Department will pay for 12.5 mm OGFC and PEM placed on ramps and end of project transitions under the appropriate mixture pay item, but the mix shall be subject to the same gradation and control sieve requirements as asphaltic concrete 9.5 mm OGFC. Add polymer-modified bituminous material, hydrated lime, and stabilizing fiber to this mix.

The Department will perform the following tasks:

1. Using the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 or 11, determine the mean of the deviations from the job mix formula per test results per lot.
2. Determine this mean by averaging the actual numeric value of the individual deviations from the job mix formula; disregard whether the deviations are positive or negative amounts.
3. Use the Asphalt Cement Content and Aggregate Gradation of Asphalt Concrete Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 to determine acceptance of surface mixes and the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 11 to determine acceptance of subsurface mixes.

---

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

On Contracts involving 1,000 tons (1000 Mg) or less of asphaltic concrete, the mixture is accepted for 100 percent payment of the asphaltic concrete Unit Price provided it meets the following:

1. Minimum requirements for a 1.00 pay factor for asphalt cement content and a 0.90 pay factor for gradation in the applicable Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 or 11.
2. Minimum requirements for a 0.90 pay factor in Table 13 of Subsection 400.5.01C, Calculate Pavement Mean Air Voids.

If the material placed on Contracts involving 1,000 tons (1000 Mg) or less of asphaltic concrete does not meet the above requirements, the material will be paid for using the applicable acceptance schedule.

# C. Calculate Pavement Mean Air Voids

The Department will determine the percent of maximum air voids for each lot by dividing the pavement mean air voids by the maximum pavement mean air voids acceptable.

The Department will determine the payment for each lot by multiplying the Contract Unit Price by the adjusted pay factor shown in the following Air Voids Acceptance schedule:

| Pay Factor | Percent of Maximum Air Voids (Lot Average of Tests) | Percent of Maximum Air Voids (Lot Average all Tests) (for Reevaluations) |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.00       | ≤100                                                | ≤100                                                                     |
| 0.97       | 100.1 — 105                                         | 100.1 — 104                                                              |
| 0.95       | 105.1 — 112                                         | 104.1— 109                                                               |
| 0.90       | 112.1 — 124                                         | 109.1 — 118                                                              |
| 0.80       | 124.1 — 149                                         | 118.1 — 136                                                              |
| 0.70       | 149.1 —172                                          | 136.1 — 153                                                              |
| 0.50       | 172.1 — 191                                         | 153.1 — 166                                                              |

When recommended by the Office of Materials and Testing, Lots receiving less than 0.5 pay factor shall be removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense.

When the range tolerance is exceeded, the Department will apply a pay factor of 0.95 as described in Subsection 400.3.06.B.2.

# D. Asphaltic Concrete for Temporary Detours

Hot mix asphaltic concrete placed on temporary detours not to remain in place as part of the permanent pavement does not require hydrated lime. Hot mix used for this purpose is paid for at an adjusted Contract Price. Ensure the payment for this item covers all cost of construction, maintenance and removal of all temporary mix. Ensure hot mix asphaltic concrete placed as temporary mix meets requirements established in Subsection 400.3.05.F.

Where the Contract Price of the asphaltic concrete for permanent pavement is let by the ton (megagram), the Contract Price for the asphaltic concrete placed on temporary detours is adjusted by subtracting $0.75/ton ($0.85/mg) of mix used.

Where the Contract price of the mix in the permanent pavement is based on the square yard (meter), obtain the adjusted price for the same mix used on the temporary detour by subtracting $0.04/yd² ($0.05/m²) per 1 in. (25 mm) plan depth.

406

---

Section 400 — Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Construction

Further price adjustments required in Subsection 400.3.06, Quality Acceptance, which are based on the appropriate adjusted Contract Price for mix used in the temporary detour work shall apply should temporary mix be left in place. Ensure hot mix asphalt produced as temporary mix containing no hydrated lime is removed and replaced with permanent mix containing hydrated lime.

# E. Determine Lot Payment

Determine the lot payment as follows:

1. When one of the pay factors for a specific acceptance lot is less than 1.0, determine the payment for the lot by multiplying the Contract Unit Price by the adjusted pay factor.
2. When two or more pay factors for a specific acceptance lot are less than 1.0, determine the adjusted payment by multiplying the Contract Unit Price by the lowest pay factor.

If the mean of the deviations from the job mix formula of the tests for a sieve or asphalt cement content exceeds the tolerances established in the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 10 or 11 and if the Engineer determines that the material need not be removed and replaced, the lot may be accepted at an adjusted unit price as determined by the Engineer. If the pavement mean air voids exceed the tolerances established in the Air Voids Acceptance Schedule – Table 13, remove and replace the materials at the Contractor’s expense. If the Engineer determines the material is not acceptable to leave in place, remove and replace the materials at the Contractor’s expense.

---

Section 402 – Hot Mix Recycled Asphaltic Concrete

# 402.2 Materials

# A. RAP Material Composition

Use RAP materials from any of the following:

- Existing roadway
- Contractor’s RAP stockpile that has been approved by the Department
- Department stockpile

NOTE: The location of Department RAP material stockpiles will be given on the plans.

Do not use RAP materials that contain alluvial gravel or local sand in any mixture placed on interstate projects except for mixtures used in shoulder construction. When used in shoulder construction, limit RAP containing local sand or alluvial gravel so that the sand or gravel contributes no more than 20 percent of the total aggregate portion of the mix.

# 1. RAP Percentage

For non-interstate projects, limit the percentage of RAP allowed in recycled mixes so that the overall amount of alluvial gravel does not exceed 5 percent of the total mix. The percentage of alluvial gravel, local sand, and Group I material in the RAP will be determined through petrographic analysis or available records.

RAP furnished to the Contractor but not used in the work remains the Contractor’s property. RAP used in the recycled mixtures for mainline or ramps (if applicable) may make up from 0 to 40 percent of the mixture depending on the amount of RAP available, the production facilities, and whether the mixture meets the requirements in Section 828.

The maximum ratio of RAP material to the recycled mixtures other than SMA is 40 percent for continuous mix type plants and 25 percent for batch type plants. The maximum ratio of RAP material to the recycled mixture is 15 percent for Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) mixes.

# 2. Process RAP Material

Process RAP material to be used in the recycled mixture so that 100 percent will pass the 2 in. (50 mm) sieve. Additional crushing and sizing may be required if the RAP aggregate exceeds the maximum sieve size for the mix type as shown in Section 828. Obtain representative materials from the RAP stockpile for the mix design.

# B. RAS Material

RAS materials are produced as a by-product of manufacturing roofing shingles and/or discarded shingle scrap from the reroofing of buildings.

# 1. Limit the amount of RAS material

Limit the amount of RAS material used in the recycled mixture to no greater than 5 percent of the total mixture weight.

# 2. Shred the RAS material

Shred the RAS material before incorporating it into the mix to ensure that 100 percent of the shredded pieces are less than 1/2 in. (12.5 mm) in any dimension.

# 3. Remove all foreign materials

Remove all foreign materials such as paper, roofing nails, wood, or metal flashing.

# 4. Provide test results for Bulk Sample Analysis

Provide test results for Bulk Sample Analysis, known as Polarized Light Microscopy, if post-consumer shingles are used to certify the RAS material is free of asbestos. Test stockpiles at the rate of one test per 1000 tons (megagrams) prior to processing.

Other than as specifically stated in this Subsection, ensure that RAS material is used according to the same requirements as described for RAP material.

# C. Asphaltic Concrete Removed from an Existing Roadway

Asphaltic concrete removed from an existing roadway becomes the Contractor’s property unless specified otherwise on the plans. RAP material retained by the Department is designated on the plans, and the RAP shall be stockpiled at the location specified on the plans.

Section 402 – Hot Mix Recycled Asphaltic Concrete

D. Local Sand and Group I Material in RAP

Use of local sand in recycled mixes is restricted as stipulated in Section 828 for the Project. However, RAP which contains local sand may be used in surface and intermediate layers of non-interstate projects so long as the RAP percentage used does not contribute more than 5% local sand to the total aggregate portion of the mix. The amount of local sand in the RAP material shall be considered when determining the percentage of local sand in the total mix.

Where Pay Items specify that Group II only aggregate is to be used, RAP which consists primarily of Group II aggregate, but contains some Group I aggregate, shall be limited such that the Group I aggregate makes up no more than 5 percent of the total aggregate portion of the mix. When a Blend I mix is specified, any Group I materials in the RAP will be considered when determining the Group I portion allowed in the total mix as specified in Subsection 828.2.A.2.

E. Asphalt Cement

Using laboratory evaluations, the Department will determine the asphalt cement grade to be used in the recycled mixture. The asphalt cement shall meet the requirements of Section 820.

When the asphalt cement is blended with asphalt cement recovered from the RAP material and after tests on residue from thin film oven tests, the asphalt cement shall have a viscosity of 6,000 to 16,000 poises (600 to 1600 Pa) or as approved by the Engineer. Recover asphalt cement from the recycled mixture to verify that the specified viscosity is being met.

If the Engineer determines during construction that the selected asphalt cement grade is not performing satisfactorily, the Department may change the asphalt cement grade in the mixture, with no change in the Contract Unit Price.

F. Recycled Mixture

The recycled mixture shall be a homogenous mixture of RAP or RAS material, virgin aggregate, hydrated lime, and neat asphalt cement. Ensure that the mixture conforms to an approved mixture design outlined in Section 828.

# 402.2.01 Delivery, Storage, and Handling

Separate the stockpiles by Project sources and by Group I and Group II aggregate types. Erect a sign on each stockpile to identify the source(s).

If RAP material from different project sources becomes intermixed in a stockpile, only use those materials when approved by the laboratory.

# Section 402 – Hot Mix Recycled Asphaltic Concrete

The material produced and placed during the mixture adjustment period is one lot. If the mix is adjusted during this period, a new lot may be necessary, but a new adjustment period will not be permitted. This material shall be paid for at 100 percent of the Contract Unit Price provided it meets the minimum requirements for a 1.00 pay factor for asphalt cement content and a 0.90 pay factor for gradation in the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 9 or 10.

If the material placed during the adjustment period fails to meet the above requirements, it will be paid for using the applicable acceptance schedule. However, when mixture used for leveling at a spread rate of 90 lbs./yd² (50 kg/m²) or less is also used for the surface mix at a spread rate greater than 90 lbs./yd² (50 kg/m²), an additional adjustment period will be allowed for compaction only. This material will be paid for at a 1.00 pay factor provided it:

- Meets the minimum requirements for a 1.00 pay factor in the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 9 or 10 for both asphalt content and gradation.
- Meets the minimum requirements for a 0.90 pay factor in Table 12 of Subsection 400.5.01C, Calculate Mean Pavement Air Voids.

# D. Asphaltic Concrete for Temporary Detours

Hot mix asphaltic concrete placed on temporary detours that will not remain in place as part of the permanent pavement does not require hydrated lime. Hot mix used for this purpose is paid for at an adjusted Contract Price. The payment for this item shall cover all cost of construction, maintenance and removal of all temporary mix. Hot mix asphaltic concrete placed as temporary mix shall meet requirements established in Subsection 400.3.05.F.

Where the Contract Price of the asphaltic concrete for permanent pavement is let by the ton (megagram), the Contract Price for the asphaltic concrete placed on temporary detours is adjusted by subtracting $0.75/ton ($0.85/mg) of mix used. Where the Contract price of the mix in the permanent pavement is based on the square yard (meter), obtain the adjusted price for the same mix used on the temporary detour by subtracting $0.04/yd² ($0.05/ m²) per 1-in. (25-mm) plan depth.

Further price adjustments required in Subsection 400.3.06, Quality Acceptance, which are based on the appropriate adjusted Contract Price for mix used in the temporary detour work shall apply should temporary mix be left in place. Hot mix asphalt produced as temporary mix containing no hydrated lime shall be removed and replaced with permanent mix containing hydrated lime.

# E. Determine Lot Payment

Determine the lot payment as follows:

1. When one of the pay factors for a specific acceptance lot is less than 1.0, determine the payment for the lot by multiplying the Contract Unit Price by the adjusted pay factor.

---

# Section 402 – Hot Mix Recycled Asphaltic Concrete

When two or more pay factors for a specific acceptance lot are less than 1.0, determine the adjusted payment by multiplying the Contract Unit Price by the lowest pay factor.

If the mean of the deviations from the job mix formula of the tests for a sieve or asphalt cement content exceeds the tolerances established in the Mixture Acceptance Schedule—Table 9 or 10 and if the Engineer determines that the material need not be removed and replaced, the lot may be accepted at an adjusted unit price as determined by the Engineer.

If the pavement mean air voids exceed the tolerances established in the Air Voids Acceptance Schedule – Table 12, remove and replace the materials at the Contractor’s expense.

If the Engineer determines that the material is not acceptable to leave in place, remove and replace the materials at the Contractor’s expense.

Section 403 – Hot In-Place Recycled Asphaltic Concrete

# 403.3.05 Construction

# A. Surface Preparation

Thoroughly clean the surface to be recycled of all dirt, vegetation, and other objectionable materials immediately prior to the affected area being recycled. Remove all metal raised pavement markers and thermoplastic paint markings prior to recycling.

# B. Heat, Remove, and Blend Materials

Evenly heat the pavement at full lane width plus a minimum 3 in. (75 mm) overlap onto adjacent pavement materials. Control the heating to ensure uniform penetration without differential softening of the surface, and so that the heated material has a temperature in the range of 240 ± 20 °F (115 ± 11 °C) measured immediately behind the heating unit. Ensure heated material temperatures do not vary greater than 20 °F (11 °C) when taken transversely across the mat behind the screed. If virgin aggregate is added, distribute the aggregate across the entire width being recycled prior to the last heat application.

Hot mill and rework the pavement to the width and depth shown in the plan typical section. Control the width of each pass to provide proper placement of longitudinal joints. Control the depth of loosened pavement to within 1/4 in. (6 mm) of the depth specified. Ensure the milled material is heated sufficiently so that it is free of lumps. Milled particles shall not be greater than 1-1/2 in. (40 mm) in size. Accomplish the recycling by using milling heads capable of gathering the loose material and conveying it to a mixing chamber. The mixing chamber should blend the material uniformly and create a windrow with the final mix. Do not use scrappers, scarifies, or any mechanical means of removing the softened pavement other than milling heads.

Ensure the final blended mix in the windrow is uniform. All aggregate shall be consistently coated. There shall be no evidence of broken or fractured aggregate in the windrowed material. Inconsistency and or non-uniformity of the windrowed material prior to placement will result in the immediate cessation of recycling until a plan of corrective action is approved by the Engineer. After modifications to the equipment or adjustment to the additives proportions have been made and approved, the Contractor should be allowed to resume work in a 500 ft. (152 m) test section to be evaluated by the Engineer prior to continuing recycling.

Blend the removed material with a rejuvenating agent (and virgin aggregate, asphalt modifier, or plant-produced hot mix asphaltic concrete, if needed) to produce a homogeneous mixture. Control the rate of application of the rejuvenator to ensure compliance with the mix design and Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) values specified in Subsection 403.3.06.A. Apply other materials as specified in the contract or as determined by the mix design analysis.

# C. Tack Coat

Apply tack coat uniformly over the milled area prior to placement of the blended materials. Control the application rate in accordance with Section 413. At any time during the recycling process it is observed that an adequate bond is not being achieved, three 6 in. (150mm) cores may be obtained for testing. These cores will be evaluated for adequate bond strength using NCAT’s bond shear device in conjunction with the Marshall Apparatus. A minimum shear strength of 50 psi shall be required in accordance with GDT-57.

# D. Application

Control placement of the mixture to produce a surface true to line, grade, and cross-slope with a uniform surface texture free of segregation, lumps, or other unacceptable streaks or blemishes as determined by the Engineer. Ensure the mixture meets the acceptance requirements for mixture quality, compaction, smoothness, and thickness as specified in Subsection 403.3.06.

# E. Overlay

Prior to overlay, allow the hot-in-place recycled material to cure for a minimum of seven (7) days or as directed by the Engineer. Overlay the recycled mixture, if required by the contract, by producing and placing a mixture that meets requirements of Section 400 and Section 402. Smoothness requirements for the hot in-place recycled mixture do not apply if the mixture is overlaid.

# 403.3.06 Quality Acceptance

# A. Mixture

Base acceptance of the materials used in the work on Section 106 and Section 400 except that pay factors for gradation and asphalt content will not apply. Take a minimum of one sample of mixture for each 4500 Sq./yd recycled per day of operation to determine quality acceptance of the mixture. Take samples directly behind the paver according to GSP 15 at the location determined by the Engineer. Perform extraction and gradation testing according to GDT 83 and GDT 38 or other suitable method approved by the Office of Materials and Testing. Determine the laboratory density, stability and flow of the mixture using the 50 blow Marshal procedure in AASHTO T-245. Report the test results daily to the District Laboratory and Bituminous Technical Services Engineer. Test results failing to meet specified tolerances are to be reported immediately. Recover the extracted asphalt cement using GDT 119 and test for dynamic shear according to AASHTO T312, Method for Determining the Rheological Properties of Asphalt Binder Using Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). Adjust the amount of rejuvenator as necessary to maintain DSR results within a range of 6,000 – 16,000 poises (6 – 16 kPa) when tested at 64 °C (147 °F). Do not continue the work until corrective adjustments are made if two consecutive samples exceed the range for DSR values. Submit test results electronically to the Engineer and Office of Materials and Testing within 24 hours after samples are taken. Thoroughly and accurately document the location of the hot in-place recycling mixture replacement for future rehabilitative projects. Future millings obtained from hot in-place recycled mixtures will become the property of the Department. Ensure that millings produced from hot in-place recycled mixtures are not incorporated into GDOT approved RAP stockpiles for use in Hot Mix Recycled Asphaltic Concrete Mixtures.

# B. Compaction

The targeted maximum Pavement Mean Air Void content for hot in-place recycled mixtures is 5.0 percent. Ensure that the maximum Pavement Mean Air Voids does not exceed 7.0 or less based on the recycled mixture’s theoretical specific gravity measured daily using the T-209 method performed on mixture sampled directly behind the paver. Determine the mixture compaction using either GDT 39, GDT 59 or AASHTO T 331. The method of GDT 39 for “Uncoated Specimens, Dense Graded Mixtures Only” shall not apply when the water absorption of a sample exceeds 2.0 percent, as measured according to AASHTO T 166. In this case, either AASHTO T 331 or the paraffin method of GDT 39 shall apply. The compaction is accepted in lots defined in Subsection 400.3.06. A “Acceptance Plans for Gradation and Asphalt Cement Content” and is within the same lot boundaries as the mixture Meet the compaction requirements of Subsection 400.3.06.B. and Subsection 400.5.01.C. The Department will perform all compaction testing. Adjust compaction operation if cracking or displacement of the recycled material is observed.

# C. Smoothness

The Department will perform acceptance testing for surface course smoothness tolerance using the Laser Road Profiler according to GDT 126. Smoothness testing will be performed on the mainline traveled way and on ramps more than one-half mile (kilometer) in length. Clean the roadway of any debris and obstructions and provide traffic control to conduct the testing when requested by the engineer. Ensure the pavement does not exceed a target smoothness index of 900. Do not continue the work until corrective adjustments have been made if the target value is exceeded. Perform corrective work at no expense to the Department by repeating the hot in-place recycling process, according to this Section, if the smoothness index exceeds 1025. Maintain a 10 ft. (3 m) straightedge in the vicinity of the paving operation at all times to use in measuring minor surface irregularities and provide the labor for its use. Correct all irregularities in excess of 1/8 in. (3 mm) in 10 ft. (3 m). Stop the operation until corrective measures are taken when irregularities such as rippling, tearing, or pulling indicate a continuing problem in equipment, mixture, or operating techniques.

# Section 403 – Hot In-Place Recycled Asphaltic Concrete

# D. Mill Depth

Mill heated material to the thickness specified in the plan typical section or contract general notes. Measure thickness acceptance cores obtained randomly as determined by the Engineer in accordance with GDT-73 or five cores per day, whichever is less, to verify mill depth. Additional cores taken for thickness may be required to isolate deficient areas.

The Department will determine the average mill depth based on roadway core measurements according to GDT 42. Mill depth will be determined based on total rejuvenated thickness less any thickness contributed by added virgin materials.

To receive full payment for mill depth, ensure the average milled depth is no less than 1/4 in. (6 mm) of that specified in the plan typical section or contract general notes. Apply a pay reduction of 25% to the total square yards (meters) applied that day if the average depth is less than that specified, by more than 1/4 in. (6 mm) but no more than 1/2 in. (13 mm) of that specified.

Take additional cores to determine the area of deficient depth if the average depth is less than that specified, by more than 1/2 in. (13 mm).

# E. Corrections

Correct any areas deficient in depth by more than 1/2 in. (13 mm) by repeating the hot in-place recycling process at no expense to the Department. Stop the work until corrective measures are made if the average mill depth for two consecutive days is less than 1/4 in. (6 mm) of that specified. No individual location shall be recycled more than 2 times. If after the second recycling process, the deficiency is still apparent, mill and in-lay this location with plant produced asphaltic concrete. The plant produced asphaltic concrete shall be equivalent to the recycled design properties.

# F. Test Section and Acceptance

The contractor shall be granted a 1 lane mile (1600 m) test section at the beginning of construction to be evaluated by the Office of Materials and Testing for acceptance prior to continuing recycling. If any specified requirement is not obtained, work shall be immediately stopped. If at any time during construction, it is determined that the Contractor’s equipment and recycling techniques cannot consistently meet requirements, the recycling operation shall be stopped until the Office of Materials and Testing reviews and approves all modifications in equipment and recycling techniques. The Contractor shall place a 500 ft. (152 m) test section to be evaluated and accepted by the Office of Materials and Research prior to resuming recycling.

# G. Rutting susceptibility test.

Section 405 — Hot Asphalt-Vulcanized Rubber Seal Treatment

# 405.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 405.3.05 Construction

# A. Mixing

Mix asphalt and rubber as follows:

1. Before adding the rubber, ensure that the temperature of the asphalt is no higher than 325 °F (160 °C) for PG 58-22.
2. Rapidly combine the rubber with the asphalt. Mix the rubber until the material approaches a semi-fluid consistency. Ensure that the weight proportions of the two materials are as follows:

| Asphalt | 75 ± 2% |
| ------- | ------- |
| Rubber  | 25 ± 2% |

Mix the hot asphalt and rubber for at least 5 minutes.

NOTE 1: Design the rubber and asphalt combination method to ensure that the Engineer can determine the percentages by weight of each component to be mixed. Ensure that the mixing equipment can produce a homogenous mixture of rubber and asphalt to prevent separation.

NOTE 2: Preheating, precoating, and covering aggregate with canvas may be waived if proper facilities are not available and if application conditions are favorable. Precoating is often used for dust control.

After the asphalt and rubber have reacted fully, add a diluent to:
- Temporarily reduce the viscosity of the mixture
- Improve the spraying action from the distributor
- Provide a better coating of cover aggregate

The diluent amount is 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent, by volume, of the hot asphalt-rubber composition. When adding the diluent, ensure that the temperature of the hot asphalt-rubber composition does not exceed 350 °F (175 °C).

# B. Spreading

Spread the asphalt-rubber mixture as follows:

1. When the proper consistency is reached, immediately begin application. Never hold the mixture at temperatures over 325 °F (160 °C) for more than 1.5 hours after reaching application consistency.
2. Use the following application rates:
1. In areas where temperatures remain above 20 °F (–7 °C) during the winter season, apply the hot asphalt-rubber mixture at 0.55 gallons/yd², ± 0.03 gallons/yd² (2.5 liters/m², ± 0.15 liters/m²).
2. In areas where temperatures drop below 20 °F (-7 °C); apply the mixture at 0.60 gal/yd², ± 0.03 gal/yd² (2.7 liters/m², ± 0.15 liters/m²) unless otherwise specified by the Engineer. Application rates are based on 7.5 lbs./gal (0.90 kg/L), hot, and conversions to the standard 60 °F (15 °C) are not necessary.

NOTE: Place the hot asphalt-rubber mixture only when the ambient temperature is 60 °F (15 °C) or above and rising.
3. Apply the cover aggregate at 25 to 40 lbs./yd² (14 to 22 kg/m²), which is 25 to 27 lbs. (14 to 15 kg) for No. 7 stone and 35 to 39 lbs. (19 to 21 kg) for No. 8 stone, or as directed by the Engineer.

4. Perform at least four complete coverages with the pneumatic rollers. Roll the cover aggregate immediately after application to ensure maximum aggregate embedment. Do not permit traffic on the completed surface until approved by the Engineer.

5. If heavy or high-speed traffic may displace the cover aggregate, apply 5 to 10 lbs./yd² (2.5 to 5.0 kg/m²) of sand after rolling and before opening the lane to traffic as directed.

6. Sweep the joint edges clean of overlapping cover aggregate before applying the adjacent asphalt–rubber material.

7. Avoid skips and overlaps at joints and protect the surfaces of adjacent structures from being spattered or marred. These defects will be corrected at the Contractor’s expense.

8. Make transverse joints as follows:

- a. Place building paper over the ends of the previous applications.
- b. Start the adjoining application on the building paper.
- c. Remove and dispose of the paper to the Engineer’s satisfaction.

9. In urban areas, remove excess chips within 24 hours after placing. Do not use gutter brooms or steel-tined brooms, and do not disturb the loose chips from parkways, sidewalks, and intersecting streets. Continue this operation until excess or loose rock is removed from the roadway surface and abutting Rights-of-Way.

Section 407 — Asphalt-Rubber Joint and Crack Seal

# A. Workability

The mixture pours readily and penetrates a 1/4 in. (6 mm) pavement joint or crack to a depth of at least 1 in. (25 mm) when the application temperature of the fully reacted mixture is 350 ºF (177 ºC) and the air temperature is 35 ºF (2 ºC) or higher.

The mixture, when placed in conventional field installation equipment, readily melts to a pumping consistency after being heated to 400 °F (204 °C) for 2 hours maximum. The mixture remains in a pumping consistency when the temperature of the field installation equipment is reduced to the normal operating temperature range of 300 ºF to 350 ºF (149 ºC to 177 ºC).

# B. Curing

The mixture contains no water or volatile solvents and cures immediately when cooled to a sufficient viscosity to prevent tracking caused by traffic.

# C. Softening Point, Flexibility and Rubber Content.

When a fully reacted mixture sample of asphalt-rubber has been heated at 350 ºF (177 ºC) for one hour, or when a PMAR blend has been heated at 380 ºF (194 ºC) for one hour, ensure it passes the following laboratory tests:

# 1. Softening Point

The minimum softening point by ring and ball described in ASTM D 36 is as follows:

| PMAR   | 185 ºF (85 ºC) |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Type S | 135 ºF (57 ºC) |
| Type M | 150 ºF (65 ºC) |

# 2. Flexibility

Bend a 1/8 in. (3 mm) thick x 1 in. (25 mm) wide x 6 in. (150 mm) long mixture specimen after conditioning to 10 ºF (-12 ºC) at a minimum bending rate of 9 degrees per second (10 seconds maximum for a 90º bend) over a 1 in. (25 mm) diameter mandrel without cracking.

# 3. Rubber Content %

Type M and Type S minimum rubber content %.

| Type S | 15% minimum |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Type M | 15% minimum |

# D. Separation

Test the PMAR blend for phase separation by pouring two representative samples of the mixture into aluminum tubes measuring 1 in. (25 mm) in diameter and 5-1/2 in. (140 mm) long as described in ASTM D 7173. Cure the samples at 325 ºF (163 ºC) for 48 hours. Take samples from the top and bottom of each tube and determine softening point as described in ASTM D 36. Average the test results from the top and bottom samples. If there is 4 percent or more difference between the average test result and either of the top or bottom test results, reject the mixture due to separation.

# E. Adhesion

When cooled, the mixture bonds strongly to both asphalt and concrete pavement surfaces. The mixture contains no materials chemically reactive with these surfaces to reduce the short-term and long-term adhesion bonds.

- Cement or lime stabilized bases or sub-bases, regardless of pavement thickness
- Soil or aggregate bases or sub-bases on which bituminous surface treatment will be placed
- Soil or aggregate bases or sub-bases on which less than 5 in. (125 mm) total thickness of hot mix asphaltic concrete will be placed

Prime is not required on driveway construction and paved shoulders.

# A. Weather Limitations

Do not apply bituminous prime under any of these conditions:

- Surface is wet.
- Air temperature is below 40 ºF (4 ºC) in the shade.
- Rain is imminent.
- Weather conditions may prevent proper prime coat construction.

# B. Condition of Surface

Ensure that the surface to which the prime is to be applied has been finished to the line, grade, and cross-section specified.

Ensure that the surface is uniformly compacted and bonded. Correct surface irregularities according to the specifications for the construction being primed.

# C. Cleaning

Remove from the road loose material, dust, caked clay, and other material that may prevent bonding of the prime with the surface. Use power sweepers or blowers the full width of the prime and 2 ft. (600 mm) more on each side. Where necessary, sweep by hand.

# D. Moisture

Ensure that the surface is only slightly damp. If the surface is too wet, allow it to dry. If it is too dry, the Engineer may require that it be sprinkled lightly just before priming.

# E. Temperature and Surface Texture

The surface texture and condition of the surface determine the bituminous material grades to be used. The following table shows the bituminous material grades and application temperatures as they are applied to various surface textures.

# Section 412 — Bituminous Prime

Heat and apply bituminous materials as specified in Subsection 424.3.05.D, Heating Bituminous Material and Subsection 424.3.05.E, Applying Bituminous Material.

# F. Amount and Extent of Prime

The Engineer will determine the exact amount of bituminous material to be used within minimum and maximum rates of 0.15 to 0.30 gal/yd² (0.7 to 1.4 liters/m²). Apply the specified amount as follows:

1. Apply the determined amount uniformly and accurately. Ensure that the amount applied to any 0.5-mile (800 m) section is within 5 percent of the amount specified.
2. Apply the prime the full width of the proposed wearing surface that will be superimposed plus 6 in. (150 mm) more on each side.

# G. Protection, Curing, and Maintenance

Do the following after priming the surface:

1. Close to Traffic
Do not allow traffic on the primed surface. Leave the surface undisturbed until the prime thoroughly cures and does not pick up under traffic.
2. Roll
If the surface becomes soft after it is primed, roll the surface longitudinally with a pneumatic-tired roller at no more than 6 mph (10 kph) until the surface is firmly set.
3. Blot
If necessary to prevent the prime from being picked up, spread clean, dry, sharp sand over the surface by hand or mechanically. Apply sand only to places that are tacky and use the least amount needed to prevent pick up. No extra payment for this work or material will be made.
4. Open to Traffic
After rolling and sanding (if required), open the primed surface to ordinary traffic subject to the conditions in Subsection 412.3.05.G.1, Close to Traffic.
5. Curing and Maintenance
The primed surface is properly cured when it has penetrated the base sufficiently to not be picked up or displaced by traffic. Temperature and weather conditions may increase curing time. Insure the primed surface has cured to the satisfaction of the Engineer prior to its being covered by other construction.
6. Maintain the prime coat and the primed surface course until it is covered by other construction. Repair potholes, scabs, and soft spots prior to covering with other construction. Remove excess bituminous material.

# 415.3 Construction Requirements

The requirements established in Section 400 are to be followed for asphaltic concrete mixture production and placement, materials, equipment, and acceptance plans except as noted or modified in this specification.

# 415.3.01 Personnel

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 415.3.02 Construction

Asphaltic concrete plants that produce mix for Department use are governed by Quality Assurance for Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete Plants in Georgia, Laboratory Standard Operating Procedure No. 27. Follow requirements established in Section 400 for production and placement, materials, equipment, acceptance plans and adjustments except as noted or modified in this specification.

- A. Apply a bituminous tack coat according to Section 413. The Engineer will determine the application rate, which must be within the limits of 0.06 gal/yd² to 0.10 gal/yd² (0.27 L/m² to 0.45 L/m²) (residual asphalt cement).
- B. The mix shall be produced and placed at a temperature of 250°F with a tolerance of ± 20°F.
- C. Place the mix to a compacted lift thickness of 1-inch (25 mm). For construction purposes, the target thickness will be converted to spread rate based on the bulk specific gravity of the asphaltic concrete mixture being used as shown in the following equation:

Spread rate (lbs./yd²) = t * Gmb* 46.8  (Spread rate (kg/ m²) = t * Gmb)

Where:  t = Compacted lift thickness (inches, mm)

Gmb= bulk specific gravity of the mix from the approved mix design

The spread rate shall be controlled within 10 lbs./yd² (6 kg/m²).
- D. Do not place mix at air temperatures below 50 °F (10 °C).
- E. The mix shall be compacted in a manner to achieve 18 to 23 percent in-place air voids. Steel wheel rollers operating in static mode only will be used to seat the lift of Asphaltic Concrete Open Graded Crack Relief Interlayer mixture. Pneumatic tire rollers shall not be allowed on the Asphaltic Concrete Open Graded Crack Relief Interlayer mat.

# 415.4 Measurement

Asphaltic Concrete Open Graded Crack Relief Interlayer mixture, complete, in place and accepted, is measured in tons (megagrams). If the spread rate exceeds the upper limits outlined in Subsection 415.3.02.C by > 15 lbs./yd², the mix in excess will not be paid for. If the rate of the spread is ≤ 10 lbs./yd² than the lower limit, the deficient course is subject to correction by overlaying the entire lot. The mixture used for correcting deficient areas is paid for at the Contract Unit Price of the course being corrected and is subject to mixture control requirements established in Table 2 – Asphaltic Concrete Open Graded Crack Relief Interlayer Mixture Design and Control. After the deficient course has been corrected, the total spread rate for that lot is recalculated, and the mix in excess of the upper limits outlined in Subsection 415.3.02.C will not be paid for.

# 415.5 Payment

Asphaltic Concrete Open Graded Crack Relief Interlayer mix is paid for at the Contract Unit Price per ton (megagram). Payment is full compensation for furnishing and placing materials including asphalt cement, hydrated lime, approved additives, and for cleaning and repairing, preparing surfaces, hauling, mixing, spreading, rolling, and performing other operations to complete the Contract Item.

- Produces work that complies with the standards in this section
- Is on the Project and in proper working order before construction begins and during construction.

# A. Aggregate Spreader

The Department will inspect annually the aggregate spreader before it is used in the work. If the spreader is approved, the Department will attach an equipment certification sticker to the spreader. Use a self-propelled aggregate spreader that can apply aggregate at the desired rate uniformly and accurately without corrugation, overlaps, or excess deficient areas. Ensure that the spreader can spread courses to the required widths. Provide spreaders to promptly cover the full width of the asphalt application.

# B. Pressure Distributor

The Department will inspect annually the pressure distributor before it is used in the work. If the distributor is approved, the Department will attach an equipment certification sticker to the distributor. The pressure distributor should be equipped as follows:

1. Mount the pressure distributor on pneumatic tires wide enough to prevent damage to the road surface.
2. Design, equip, maintain, and operate the distributor so that the bituminous material will be heated and applied evenly throughout the length of the spray bars. Ensure that it maintains a constant, uniform pressure on the nozzles.
3. Install screens between the tank and the nozzles and clean them frequently to prevent clogging.
4. Use an adjustable distributor that can deliver controlled amounts of bituminous material from 0.04 to 1.0 gal/yd², ± 0.02 gal/yd² (0.18 to 4.53 L/m², ± 0.10 L/m²) up to 24 ft. (7.2 m) wide without atomization, streaking, or pulsation in the flow.

---

Section 424 — Bituminous Surface Treatment

5. Use a distributor equipped with the following:

- A tachometer and thermometers to indicate the application rate and the temperature of the tank contents
- Measuring devices to accurately indicate the amount of bituminous material, in gallons (liters), in the distributor before and after each application
- Full circulating spray bars that can be adjusted laterally to conform to a stringline and capable of vertical and horizontal adjustment.
- A positive shut-off control to prevent dripping bituminous material on the roadway
- A distributor tank equipped with a sample valve in a safe and convenient location to obtain bituminous material samples

# C. Heating Equipment

Ensure that heating equipment will heat and maintain the bituminous material uniformly at the temperature required. Provide an accurate thermometer.

# D. Steel-Wheeled Rollers

Use self-propelled, tandem-type steel-wheeled rollers. The rollers shall weigh from 3 to 8 tons (3 to 7 Mg). Ensure that the roller weights within these limits can properly seat the aggregate without fracturing the aggregate particles. Equip the roller drums with scrapers to prevent pick up of material. Combination rollers with pneumatic-tired wheels that can be alternated with a steel drum are permitted as a substitute for steel-wheeled rollers.

# E. Pneumatic-Tired Rollers

Use self-propelled, two axles, pneumatic-tired rollers with smooth-tread rubber tires aligned such that gaps between the tires on one axle are covered by the tires of the other axle. Equip the roller tires with scrapers and scrubbers to prevent pick up of material. Ensure that all tires are of the same size and ply rating and inflated to a minimum of 60 psi (415 kPa). Maintain tire pressure such that the difference in pressure between any two tires does not exceed 5 psi (35 kPa). Provide ballast as directed by the Engineer.

# F. Power Broom and Power Blower

Provide at least one power broom and one power blower, or a combination power broom and blower that can remove dust or loose materials from the road surface.

# 424.3.03 Preparation

Firmly compact, finish, and prime new bases. Ensure that the bases conform to the lines, grades, and cross sections within the tolerances specified.

# A. Removing Foreign Material

Use power brooms, power blowers, hand brooms, or other means to remove loose material, dust, dirt, clay, and other materials that prevent bituminous materials from adhering to the base. Take special care to clean the outer edges thoroughly. Where necessary, use a motor grader blade to remove excess material off the paving edge.

# B. Condition of Prime

Check the condition of prime as follows:

1. Ensure the prime is cured before placing the mat course.
2. Repair the prime if it is loose, soft, unbonded, removed, or damaged.
3. Remove concentrations of excess prime.
4. Perform additional rolling with a pneumatic-tired roller before surface treatment when directed by the Engineer.

# Section 424 — Bituminous Surface Treatment

# 424.3.05 Construction

# A. Observing Seasonal and Weather Limitations

Apply bituminous surface treatment only between April 15 and October 15 and only when:

- Ambient temperature has not been less than 45 ºF (7 ºC) for 48 hours immediately prior to application.
- No forecast of ambient temperature less than 45 ºF (7 ºC) for 48 hours immediately following application.
- Ambient temperature and road surface temperature is at least 60 ºF (16 ºC) and stable at the time of application.

No exceptions are permitted except as authorized by the Engineer. Do not apply asphalt cement to a wet surface.

NOTE 1: When the relative humidity exceeds 80%, the ambient temperature exceeds 95 ºF (35 ºC), the pavement temperature exceeds 125 ºF (52 ºC) or the weather is windy or overcast, application of bituminous surface treatment will be at the discretion of the Engineer.

NOTE 2: If hot mix asphaltic concrete will be applied over the surface treatment, the Engineer may waive the seasonal limitations providing that traffic is not permitted on the surface treatment until it is covered with hot mix asphaltic concrete.

# B. Using PG 64-22 or CRS-3

Only use PG 64-22 or CRS-3 when directed by the Engineer due to a problem with excessive aggregate pickup during high ambient temperature.

# C. Observing Sequence of Operations and Quantities of Materials

The sequence of operations and quantities of materials are shown in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 (Table 1a—metric, Table 2a—metric and Table 3a—metric).

The Engineer will determine the material quantities to be used during construction and may change the minimum or maximum application rate of any course during construction if the total quantities are within the amounts shown in the Tables. Any deviation from the table quantities will require a negotiated adjustment of the Contract price authorized by an approved Supplemental Agreement.

When a single application of bituminous surface treatment is used as a Crack-Relief Interlayer, use the quantities of materials shown in Table 2 (Table 2a—Metric).

When a sand seal application is Specified, use the quantities of materials shown in Table 3 (Table 3a—Metric).

Section 424 — Bituminous Surface Treatment

The Engineer will designate the maximum area to which bituminous material may be applied at one time. Apply the material as follows:

1. After applying the bituminous material to the section, immediately cover it with the correct application rate of aggregate before beginning the next section. Do not apply the bituminous material to the full width of the pavement unless the aggregate spreader can immediately cover the full width of the applied material.

NOTE: Never allow bituminous material to chill, set up, dry, or reach a condition that impairs the retention of cover aggregate before the aggregate is applied.

When a longitudinal joint is necessary:
- Do not overlap the applications more than 4 in. (100 mm).
- Do not leave any area uncovered.
- Never allow excess quantities of bituminous materials to build up.

On curves that require widening:

Shoot the extra width on the outside first.
Shoot the normal width with the distributor and follow the inside paving edge.

Ensure that the spray of bituminous material is uniform at all times. If the spray is not uniform:

Stop the work.
Change equipment, personnel, or methods to attain the required uniformity.
Apply bituminous material at one-half the width of the roadway, if necessary.

If streaking develops:

Stop the distributor and correct the problem before proceeding.
Use a hand hose or a hand pouring pot to cover the streaked areas at approximately the same application rate of bituminous material.

If a part of the work cannot be reached by the distributor, treat it by hand hoses with nozzles.
Protect curbs, gutters, handrails, and other structures from discoloration by the bituminous material. Remove bituminous material that is sprayed or spilled on these structures.
Ensure that the bituminous material joins neatly in place by beginning and ending the asphalt application from a heavy paper or tight trough that is longer than the width of the treatment being applied. Place it to catch and hold the surplus material.
When cleaning and emptying the distributor, empty it where the bituminous material can be covered with dirt and completely disposed of without damaging the Rights-of-Way.

# F. Spreading Aggregates

Spread the aggregates as follows:

1. Ensure that aggregates do not contain free moisture when spread.
2. Apply aggregate immediately after applying bituminous materials.
3. Uniformly spread the aggregate at the specified rate without corrugations, overlaps, excess, or deficient areas.
4. Move the spreader at a uniform speed, regardless of the grade.
5. Ensure that the distance that the aggregate free falls remains constant during spreading.

Section 424 — Bituminous Surface Treatment

# G. Rolling

Observe the following guidelines for rolling bituminous surface treatment:

1. Synchronize the speed of the distributor and aggregate spreader with that of the rolling operation.
2. Use a minimum of two (2) individual rollers, one of which must be a pneumatic-tired roller meeting the requirements of Subsection 424.3.02.E.
3. If a steel-wheeled roller will fracture the aggregate, use pneumatic-tired rollers only.
4. Begin rolling within one minute after spreading the aggregate.
5. Operate rollers at speeds not exceeding 5 mph.
6. Proceed in a longitudinal direction, beginning at the outside edge of the aggregate application.
7. A roller pass is defined as one trip in a single direction.
8. Overlap each roller pass by approximately 1/2 the roller width.
9. Provide a minimum of three (3) roller passes per roller for each layer of aggregate to properly embed the aggregate particles.

Note: Unless a sufficient number of rollers are in operation to complete the above requirements, do not make subsequent applications of bituminous material until rolling of the previous application is completed.

# H. Brooming

Use a revolving broom as necessary, supplemented by hand brooming, to remove or redistribute excess stone. Sweep the completed surface treatment within the first three hours of the next available workday following placement. Take care not to unseat bonded stone when sweeping.

# I. Controlling Traffic

Do not allow traffic on the surface treatment until the bituminous material has cured sufficiently to ensure that the aggregate will not be loosened, dislodged, or whipped off by slow moving traffic. Control traffic to speeds not exceeding 25 mph for a minimum of two hours after application of the seal stone and until the Engineer permits the road to be opened to normal traffic speeds. Use pilot vehicles to control traffic speeds.

Section 427 — Emulsified Asphalt Slurry Seal

Emulsified asphalt slurry seal is used to seal small cracks and correct moderate surface condition. Apply this type at a rate of 10 to 20 lbs./yd² (5.5 to 11 kg/m²) based on dry aggregate weight. If more than 20 lbs./yd² (11 kg/m²) of emulsified asphalt slurry seal is required, apply additional lifts of the same mixture. Maintain the gradation and percent residual asphalt as shown on the slurry seal design or as established by the Engineer within the mixture control tolerances listed.

# 427.2.01 Delivery, Storage, and Handling

# A. Transporting and Storing Asphalt Emulsions

Transport asphalt emulsions using containers free of foreign material. Asphalt emulsion will not be accepted if a transporting vehicle has leaked or spilled during transit. Store the asphalt emulsion in stationary rail or truck tanks that can be used to fill the slurry seal truck tanks. Equip the storage and truck tanks to prevent water from entering the emulsion. Provide heat if necessary to prevent freezing.

# B. Stockpiling Aggregates

Stockpile the aggregate in an area that drains readily. Take precautions to prevent stockpile contaminations such as soil, vegetation, or oversize rock. Load the aggregate on to the slurry seal trucks without segregating it.

# 427.3 Construction Requirements

# 427.3.01 Personnel

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 427.3.02 Equipment

Equipment, tools, and machines used to perform this work are subject to the Engineer’s approval. The Engineer may discontinue the work if more equipment and tools are needed to place the materials. Do not use malfunctioning equipment to perform the work.

# A. Slurry Mixing Equipment

Before slurry seal placement begins, furnish the Engineer with a calibration of the slurry mixing equipment. Ensure that the mixing machine is equipped with the following:

- Revolution counter to count the feeder belt revolutions continuously or intermittently as desired by the Engineer
- Water pressure system and a fog-type spray bar to fog the surface prior to spreading the slurry mix
- Continuous flow mixing unit that can deliver a predetermined proportion of aggregate, water, mineral filler, and asphalt emulsion to the mixing chamber and discharge the thoroughly mixed product continuously

Pre-wet the aggregate and mineral filler in the machine immediately before mixing it with the emulsion.

NOTE: Use caution when mixing to ensure that the emulsion does not set up prematurely.

# B. Slurry Spreading Equipment

Use a mechanical squeegee spreader with a flexible strike-off that contacts the surface (ensure that the spreader is adjustable to spread evenly and to prevent loss of slurry on varying grades and crowns). Use a spreader equipped with augers, a steering device, a flexible strike-off, and a device to adjust the coverage width. Keep the spreader box clean and free of asphalt and aggregate build-up. The type of flexible strike-off and the burlap drags or other drags are subject to the Engineer’s approval.

Section 427 — Emulsified Asphalt Slurry Seal

# 427.3.03 Preparation

Immediately before applying the slurry:

1. Remove loose material, silt spots, vegetation, and other objectionable material from the pavement. If the pavement has considerable cracks, do not flush it with water.
2. Prepare the surface as specified in the Standard Specifications for slurry seal.

# 427.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 427.3.05 Construction

# A. Observe Weather Limitations

Do not apply slurry seal if the pavement or ambient temperature is 55 °F (13 °C) or below and falling. If both the ambient and pavement temperatures are 45 °F (7 °C) or above and rising, the slurry seal may be applied. If the relative humidity exceeds 80 percent or the weather is overcast, the Engineer will determine when to apply the slurry seal.

# B. Apply Tack Coat

Before placing the slurry seal, apply a bituminous tack coat consisting of one-part emulsion and three parts water to the old surface as follows:

1. Apply a tack coat with the same asphalt emulsion type and grade as used in the slurry seal.
2. Apply the tack coat according to Section 413.
3. Apply the tack coat with an asphalt distributor.
4. Apply the tack coat at a rate of 0.05 to 0.10 gal/yd² (0.23 to 0.46 L/m²) of the diluted emulsion. The Engineer will determine the exact application rate.

# C. Prepare the Mix

Prepare the mix as follows:

1. Thoroughly mix the material proportions approved for use. Do not mix for more than four minutes.
2. Adjust the amount of water or mineral filler to reach the desired consistency.
3. If the proper slurry consistency cannot be maintained, stop the work and correct the problem by changing the proportions or material sources.

# D. Apply the Slurry Seal

Place the slurry seal uniformly across the width of the traffic lane unless otherwise specified or directed by a Special Provision in the proposal or the Engineer. Carry enough slurry seal in the spreader to completely cover the surface. Apply the slurry seal as follows:

1. Adjust the squeegee action to permit the mix to flow freely and leave a smooth surface.
2. If local conditions require, pre-wet the surface with water by fogging ahead of the slurry box. Closely control pre-wetting to prevent water runoff or puddling.
3. Do not deposit slurry mixture that is not the desired consistency.
4. After depositing the slurry, do not add additional elements.



---

# Section 427 — Emulsified Asphalt Slurry Seal

1. Prevent the following:
- Lumping, balling, or unmixed aggregate
- Segregation of the emulsion and aggregate fines from the coarse aggregate
- Excessive buildup or unsightly appearance on longitudinal or transverse joints
2. If the coarse aggregate settles to the bottom of the mix, remove the slurry from the pavement.
3. Place longitudinal joints on two-lane roadways as close to the center of the pavement as possible. If the roadway has more than two lanes of traffic, place the longitudinal joints as close as possible to where traffic stripes will be placed.

# E. Apply by Hand

Use approved squeegees to spread slurry in areas that are not accessible to the slurry spreader. Do not leave unsightly marks from the hand work.

# F. Control Traffic

Do not allow traffic on the slurry seal until it has cured enough to withstand marring and tearing, and until no water will be pumped to the surface. Control traffic as necessary to prevent damage to the slurry. Repair any traffic damage to the slurry seal at the Contractor’s expense.

# G. Observe Seasonal Limitations

Apply slurry seal between the dates given in the Table below. The dates are given by zones shown on the Georgia Geographic Map, below. The Engineer shall authorize any exceptions.

| Zones | Dates                 |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 1     | April 15 – October 1  |
| 2     | April 10 – October 25 |

# 428.2 Materials

The materials to be used and their specifications are listed below:

# A. Aggregate

Use aggregate in micro-surfacing that meets the requirements of Subsection 802.2.02.

EXCEPTION: Aggregate shall be manufactured from Group II, Class A or B crushed stone or slag, and the Sand Equivalent Value shall not be less than 65 when tested according to AASHTO T-176.

Ensure that aggregates shipped to the project are uniform and do not require blending or pre-mixing at the storage area before use. Aggregates must meet the appropriate gradation as shown in Table 1.

# B. Mineral Filler

Use mineral filler that is Portland cement or hydrated lime which meets the following requirements:

- Portland cement: Section 830 and 883
- Hydrated Lime: Section 882 and 883

# C. Cationic Asphalt Emulsion

Ensure that the emulsified asphalt is a cationic type CSS-lh (LRA) or CSS-1P that meets the requirements for CSS-1h of Section 824, modified to waive the cement-mixing test.

# D. Latex Rubber Additive (LRA)

Ensure the LRA is a natural latex or an unvulcanized styrene-butadine rubber in an emulsified latex form. Provide certification from the LRA manufacturer that the LRA meets the following requirements:

| Rubber Solids content, Minimum %, ASTM D 1417  | 60 (by weight) |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- |

| Total Ash, Maximum %, ASTM D 297               | 3.5            |

Co-mill the LRA and the special emulsifiers with the asphalt cement while manufacturing the emulsified asphalt to produce a homogeneous mixture. Add the LRA in the necessary proportions to result in 3% neat latex by weight of residual asphalt cement in the emulsion. Ensure the LRA modified emulsified asphalt, when left undisturbed for 24 hours, shows no separation of emulsion and LRA and no color striations, but has a uniform color throughout. Ensure that the residue from the LRA modified emulsified asphalt has a minimum softening point of 135 °F (60 °C) when tested according to AASHTO T-53.

EXCEPTION: The maximum test temperature shall not exceed 350° F (176°C) and the duration shall not exceed 20 minutes.

Formulate the emulsified asphalt to allow the paving mixture to cure at a rate that will permit traffic on the pavement within 1 hour after application without damaging the pavement surface.

# E. Bituminous Tack Coat

Use a cationic asphalt emulsion CSS-lh or CQS-lh for the bituminous tack coat that meets Section 824 and is diluted according to Subsection 428.3.05.D.

# F. Water

Use water for the micro-surfacing mixture that is potable and free of contaminants detrimental to the mixture.

Store or stockpile mineral aggregates in a manner that will prevent segregation, mixing of the various materials or sizes, and contamination with foreign materials. Do not use construction equipment on, or to ramp the stockpiled aggregate. Pass the aggregate over a scalping screen immediately before transferring it to the micro-surfacing mixing machine to remove oversized material.

# B. Storage of Bituminous Material

Ensure that the bituminous storage is adequate to meet the requirements of the production rate. Always keep clean all equipment used to store and handle bituminous material and operate it in such a manner to prevent contamination with foreign matter.

# 428.3 Construction Requirements

# 428.3.01 Personnel

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 428.3.02 Equipment

Obtain the Engineer’s approval for all equipment, tools, and machines used to perform this Work. Do not attempt work with malfunctioning equipment. The Engineer may stop the work if equipment and tools are not sufficient to place the materials satisfactorily.

# A. Mixing Equipment

Blend the paving mixture using a self-propelled micro-surfacing mixing machine that is:

- A continuous flow mixing unit
- Able to accurately deliver and proportion the aggregate, LRA-modified emulsion, mineral filler, field control additives, and water to a revolving multi-blade, twin shafted mixer
- Able to discharge the mixed product on a continuous flow.

EXCEPTION: Blending the paving mixture may be accomplished with a truck mounted micro-surfacing mixing machine that meets the above specification, except for continuous flow, when placing the mixture on short streets or projects that are less than one-half mile (800 m) in length.

For streets or projects less than one-half mile (800 m) in length, individual truck-mounted units may be used for placement of micro-surfacing. For streets or projects one-half mile (800 m), or greater, in length, place micro-surfacing mixture with a machine that is equipped as follows:

- Has self-loading devices that load raw materials while continuing to lay micro-surfacing, thereby minimizing construction joints
- Has opposite side driving stations to optimize longitudinal alignment
- Allows the operator to have full hydrostatic control of the forward and reverse speed while applying micro-surfacing material

Thoroughly blend the mixture so that no uncoated aggregate is visible upon discharge from the mixing unit or in samples taken from the roadway.

Section 428 — Micro Surfacing

1. Water Pressure System
Use a mixing machine equipped with a water pressure system and nozzle-type spray bar to provide a water spray ahead of and outside the spreader box when required.
2. Proportioning Devices
Use a machine equipped with individual volume or mass controls or other gauging devices for measuring and proportioning each material added to the mix. Properly calibrate, mark, and positively interlock each material control device.

Ensure that the aggregate feed to the mixer is equipped with a revolution counter or similar device to determine the amount of emulsion used at any time. Before beginning the work, calibrate each mixing unit and provide a copy of the calibration worksheet to the Engineer. Once calibrated, do not change the aggregate and emulsion flows without the Engineer’s approval. The water and additive may be adjusted in the field to control the mix properties to produce an acceptable mix.
3. Emulsion Pump
The emulsion pump shall be a heated, positive displacement type pump.
4. Spreading Equipment
Uniformly spread the micro-surfacing mixture using a mechanical-type spreader box attached to the mixer, equipped with paddles or other devices to agitate and spread the materials throughout the box. Use paddles that are designed to maintain sufficient turbulence in the mixture to prevent the material from setting-up in the box or causing side buildup and lumps. Provide a front seal to prevent loss of the mixture at the road contact surface.

Provide an adjustable rear seal to act as a strike-off. Maintain the spreader to prevent the loss of the paving mixture during surfacing super-elevated curves. Design and operate the spreader box and rear strike-off to achieve a uniform consistency and produce a free flow of material to the rear strike-off without causing skips, lumps, or tears in the finished surface. Use a spreader box capable of lateral movement or with side-shift abilities to ensure proper alignment with the roadway.

# B. Auxiliary Equipment

Provide a pressure distributor, power-broom, and power blower which meets requirements of Subsection 424.3.02.

Provide suitable crack and surface cleaning equipment, barricading equipment, hand tools, and other support equipment necessary to perform the work.

# 428.3.03 Preparation

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 428.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 428.3.05 Construction

# A. General

Produce, transport, and place the specified materials according to these specifications and as approved by the Engineer. Produce a finished micro-surfacing that has a uniform texture free from excessive scratch marks, tears, or other surface irregularities. Ensure that the cured mixture fully adheres to the underlying surface. Based on a visual examination or test results, the Engineer may reject any work due to poor workmanship, loss of texture, raveling, or apparent instability.

485

# Section 428 — Micro Surfacing

# B. Weather Limitations

Spread the micro-surfacing mixture only when:

- The ambient temperature for 48 hours immediately prior to placement has been at least 50 °F (10 °C).
- The current pavement surface and the ambient temperature is at least 50 °F (10 °C) and rising. Supply a surface temperature thermometer and a sling psychrometer and take temperature and humidity measurements as directed by the Engineer.
- The weather is not foggy or rainy.
- There is no forecast of temperatures below 32 °F (0 °C) within 48 hours from the time of placement.

Whenever the relative humidity exceeds 80 percent or the weather is overcast, the placement of micro-surfacing will be at the discretion of the Engineer.

# C. Surface Preparation

Before applying the micro-surfacing mixture, thoroughly clean all cracks and the area to be surfaced to the Engineer’s satisfaction.

# D. Tack Coat

Use a tack coat which consists of cationic asphalt emulsion CSS-1h or CQS-1h. Dilute it at the rate of one-part emulsion and three parts water, and apply with an asphalt distributor. The application rate is 0.05 to 0.10 gal/yd² (0.23 to 0.45 L/m²) of diluted emulsion per square yard (meter). Apply the tack coat according to Section 413. If the surface course is placed within 30 days of the leveling course or if the Engineer determines that excessive tracking of material is evident, a tack coat will not be required between the leveling and surface course.

# E. Application

Pre-wet the surface by spraying water ahead of and outside of the spreader box at a rate that dampens the surface without allowing water to flow freely ahead of the spreader box.

Spread the paving mixture on the prepared surface to produce a uniform finished surface. Take care when filling ruts to restore the designed profile of the pavement cross section. Excess crowning or overfilling of the rut area is not permitted. Use squeegees and lutes to spread the mixture in areas inaccessible to the spreader box and areas requiring hand spreading. Carry a sufficient amount of material at all times in all parts of the spreader box to ensure complete coverage.

Make adjustments to the additive, if necessary, to provide a slower setting time during hand spreading. If hand spreading is necessary, pour the mixture in a small windrow along one edge of the surface to be covered and uniformly spread with a hand squeegee or lute. Provide a smooth, neat seam where two passes meet.

Immediately remove excess material from the ends of each run.

# F. Traffic Control

Do not allow traffic on the micro-surfacing mixture until it has cured sufficiently to prevent pick up or marring of the surface. Repair any damage done by traffic to the mixture at no expense to the Department.

# G. Rut Filling and Leveling (Scratch) Course

When required on the Plans, provide micro-surfacing materials to fill ruts, utility cuts, depressions in the existing surface, etc. before the final surface course is placed. When ruts are no more than 1/2 in. (13 mm) in depth, construct the leveling/scratch course using a full width spreader box with a steel strike-off. Fill ruts deeper than 1/2 in. (13 mm) independently with a rut-filling spreader box, 6 ft. (1.8 m) in width, or as directed by the Engineer.

Place and open to traffic the rut filling and leveling (scratch) course at least 24 hours before surfacing.

# H. Workmanship

Excessive buildup, uncovered areas, or unsightly appearance are not permitted on longitudinal or transverse joints. Place longitudinal joints on lane lines. Excessive overlap is not permitted. Ensure straight lines along the roadway centerline, lane lines, shoulder, or edge lines. Keep lines at intersections straight to provide a neat and uniform appearance.



---



# Section 428 — Micro Surfacing

1. Finished Surface: Ensure that the finished micro-surfacing has a uniform texture free of excessive scratch marks, tears, or other surface irregularities. Excessive tear marks are considered marks that are 1/2 in. (13 mm) wide or wider and 6 in. (150 mm) or more long per 100 square yards (85 meters), or any marks 1 in. (25 mm) wide or wider or 4 in. (100 mm) long. Ensure that the edges of the micro-surfacing appear neat and that longitudinal alignment is parallel to the roadway centerline.
2. Joints and Seams: Produce neat and uniform longitudinal and transverse joints. Construct transverse joints as butt-type joints. Place longitudinal joints on lane lines when possible. Do not allow gaps between applications. Joints are acceptable if there is no more than a 1/2 in. (13 mm) vertical space for longitudinal joints nor more than 1/4 in. (6 mm) for a transverse joint between the pavement surface and a 4 ft. (1.2 m) straightedge placed perpendicular on the joint.
3. Areas the Mixing Machine Cannot Reach: Surface these areas using hand tools to provide complete and uniform coverage. Clean and lightly dampen the area to be hand worked before placing the mix. Ensure areas that require handwork produce a finished surface that is uniform in texture, dense, and has a neat appearance similar to that produced by the spreader box. Micro-surfacing material required to repair deficiencies due to unsatisfactory workmanship and the work required to mix and place the materials according to the specifications, will be provided at no expense to the Department.

# 428.3.06 Quality Acceptance

Take two samples of mixture for determining quality acceptance for each day of operation. Test the second sample only if the results of the first sample are outside mixture control tolerances. Test the samples according to GDT 125. The deviation in test results from the Job Mix Formula will be used to determine compliance with the mixture control tolerances. If more than one sample is tested, the average deviation shall be used to determine compliance.

A mixture adjustment period will be provided during the first two days of operation. If the average deviation of sample results for the first day are outside the mixture control tolerances, you may adjust equipment settings to provide a mixture within the tolerances. Samples will be taken the second day (after equipment changes, if any, have been made) and the average deviation in test results will be calculated. If the average deviation of test results for the second day is within mixture control tolerances, mixture quality will be accepted for the first two days of operation. If the average deviation from the second day is not within mixture control tolerances for percent residual asphalt content, a 2% reduction in unit price will be assessed for each 0.1 percent the residual asphalt content is outside the mixture control tolerances for each of the first two days that tolerances were exceeded.

# A. Emulsified Asphalt

Maintain the percent residual asphalt and gradation as shown on the micro-surfacing design, or as established by the Engineer, within the Mixture Control Tolerances listed in Table 1. After the adjustment period, a 2% reduction in unit price will be applied for each 0.1 percent the residual asphalt content is outside the Mixture Control Tolerance given in Table 1 for the day’s production represented by the sample. The average deviation of the samples will be used to determine conformance to the Mixture Control Tolerance. Do not continue to operate and place materials outside the mixture control tolerances. Adjust the placement operation as necessary to maintain production within the tolerances given.

# B. Aggregate Application Rate

Control the target spread rate for micro-surfacing to within plus or minus 2 lbs./yd² (1 kg/m²) of the spread rate specified in the Proposal based on the weight of dry aggregate. Mix placed in excess of the upper spread rate tolerance will not be paid for. The unit price will be reduced by 5% for each pound (0.5 kg) of aggregate per square yard (meter) less than the spread rate tolerances established above for each day’s placement of material. Accept pay reduction for deficient daily production or overlay the deficient area at full plan width and depth at the Contractor’s expense. Do not continue to operate and place materials outside the spread rate tolerances. Adjust the placement operation as necessary to maintain production within the tolerances given.

Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

# 430.3.05 Construction

# A. Mix the Concrete

Produce Portland cement concrete by combining authorized proportions of materials in batches according to the construction methods in this Specification. Mix the concrete produced in a stationary central mix plant for at least 60 seconds after all materials have entered the drum. Reduce the mix time if representative tests show that the concrete meets requirements of ASTM C 94, Requirements for Uniformity. Never reduce the mix time to less than 50 seconds.

# B. Set Forms

Set the forms as follows:

1. Compact the foundation under the forms true to grade. Set the form so that it firmly contacts the foundation for the entire length at the specified grade.
2. Prevent the forms from settling or springing under the finishing machine.
3. Clean and oil the forms before placing the concrete.

# C. Dowel Bars

Provide dowel bars at transverse joints unless otherwise noted in the Contract Plans.

# D. Place Concrete

After depositing the concrete on the grade, avoid re-handling. Unload and place it as follows:

1. Unload the concrete into an approved spreading device and mechanically spread it on the grade.
2. Place the concrete continuously between transverse joints without using intermediate bulkheads.
3. Hand spread the concrete with shovels, not rakes.

NOTE: Do not allow personnel to walk in freshly mixed concrete with shoes coated with dirt or other materials.

Thoroughly consolidate the concrete against the faces of forms and along the full length and sides of joint assemblies.
Ensure that vibration does not cause puddling or grout accumulation on the surface. For construction or expansion joints, do not use grout that accumulates ahead of the paver.
Deposit concrete near the formed joints. Dump or discharge concrete only in the center of a joint assembly.
Take slab depth measurements as follows:
1. Probe the plastic concrete behind the paver.
2. Record the station number and depth measurements at least every 500 ft. (150 m) at 3 random increments across the slab.
3. Provide these measurements to the Engineer when requested.

Take air and slump determination tests at a rate of at least three of each test evenly distributed during the workday. Provide the results to the Engineer when requested.
Keep reinforcing steel free of dirt, oil, paint, grease, mill scale, and loose or thick rust that could impair the bond of the steel to the concrete.
Arrange operations to prevent “leave-outs” in continuous reinforced concrete pavement. The Engineer may approve “leave-outs” in emergencies if a plan is approved to increase the reinforcement. The Department will not pay for extra leave-outs.

E. Place Reinforcement

Place reinforcement according to the plans and as follows:

1. Do not insert lane tie bars in unsupported sides of fresh concrete.
2. Ensure that the steel placement method does not damage or disrupt concrete.
3. Use bent lane tie bars if needed in longitudinal formed joints construction. However, replace broken or damaged bars at no additional cost to the Department.

F. Construct the Ramps

Prevent pavement slab stress by constructing a ramp of compacted earth or other material for movement on and off the pavement. Do not allow equipment that exceeds legal load limits on the pavement.

G. Consolidate and Finish

Ensure that the sequence of operations is continuous from placement to final finish.

1. Consolidation
2. Perform vibration for the full width and depth of the pavement as follows:

1. Do not allow the vibrators to misalign load transfer devices, or to contact forms or base.
2. Ensure that the vibrator amplitude is within the range recommended by the manufacturer. Use spud vibrators with an adjustable operating frequency between 8,000 and 12,000 vibrations per minute. Use surface pan vibrators with an adjustable operating frequency between 3,000 and 6,000 vibrations per minute.
3. If appropriate, use surface vibrators and internal vibrators on concrete greater than 8 in. (200 mm) thick.
4. If appropriate, use surface vibrators exclusively on pavements less than 8 in. (200 mm) thick.
5. Stop vibration when the machine cannot go forward.
6. Obtain uniform consolidation and density throughout the pavement. If it is not uniform, stop the operation and provide methods or equipment that will produce pavement that conforms to the Specifications.

# Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

Perform saw-grooving to meet the following dimensions:

| Width   | 1/8 in. (3 mm)                   |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| Depth   | 3/16 in. (5 mm)                  |
| Spacing | 3/4 in. (19 mm) center-to-center |

g. If required, use hand tools to texture ramps, acceleration lanes, and deceleration lanes to surface texture mainline requirements. Finish irregular sections to a surface texture of at least 0.025 in. (0.64 mm) as shown in GDT 72.

# 3. Numbering Stations

Cast station numbers with a die in the pavement every 500 ft. (200 m) and 1 ft. (300 mm) from the right edge of the travel lane.

# 4. Protection from Rain

Protect the unhardened concrete from rain. See Subsection 430.2.D, Protective Materials. When rain is imminent, stop paving operations and place forms against the sides of the pavement. Cover the surface of the unhardened concrete with the protective covering.

# H. Remove Forms

Do not remove forms from freshly placed concrete until it has set for at least 12 hours, unless otherwise provided.

1. Remove forms carefully to avoid damaging the pavement.
2. After removing the forms, immediately cure the sides of the slab using the same method used to cure the pavement surface.
3. Remove and replace major honeycombed areas.

# I. Work at Night

Provide adequate lighting for work performed at night. If lighting will not be provided at night, stop the concreting operation in time to finish and saw during daylight hours.

# J. Provide Joints

Ensure that joints are designed, configured, and located as shown on the Plans or required by the specifications.

1. Provide dowel bars at transverse joints unless otherwise noted.
2. Remove and replace plain concrete pavement that cracks during construction with no additional cost to the Department, at the Engineer’s discretion.
3. When chipping out random cracks for sealing, use nonrigid epoxy on cracks that are not under expansion-contraction influence and that meet Subsection 886.2.01.
4. Seal continuous cracks that are under movement with sealant that meets Subsection 833.2.06.
5. When removing and replacing a pavement section, remove an area at least 6 ft. (1.8 m) long and the full width of the lane.
1. Saw to vertical face the sections to be removed and replace the concrete as a construction joint with dowels.
2. Use deformed bars as dowels in the saw-cut construction joint. Use the size specified for contraction joints in the plans.
6. Thoroughly clean the drilled holes of contaminants and set the dowels into the hardened concrete face of the existing pavement with a Type VIII epoxy bonding compound. See Section 886 for epoxy bonding requirements.

---

Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

7. For contraction joints, use undamaged and properly positioned dowels in existing construction or slab replacement areas. Coat the protruding dowel portions with a thin film of heavy grease.

8. When both sides of an existing construction or contraction joint require slab replacements, replace slabs continuously from saw-cut construction joint to saw-cut construction joint. Use dowels specified for contraction joints.

9. Before placing concrete, uniformly apply a thin coat of heavy grease to epoxy-coated dowels.

10. When placing slabs continuously across transverse contraction joint locations, use saw-cuts to provide planes of weakness according to the requirements of this Specification and the standard drawing for contraction joints.

# K. Types of Joints

# 1. Longitudinal Joints

For longitudinal joints, use unpainted and uncoated deformed steel bars that are the size and length specified on the plans. Place the bars perpendicular to the joint using a mechanical device, or rigidly secure the bars in place with supports.

# 2. Longitudinal Formed Joints

Construct longitudinal formed joints while the concrete is in a plastic state. Use methods and equipment that locate the joint reinforcement properly without disrupting it during construction.

# 3. Longitudinal Sawed Joints

Cut longitudinal sawed joints with a mechanical saw within three days after the concrete is placed and before traffic or equipment enters the pavement.

# 4. Transverse Joints

Transverse joints consist of construction joints, contraction joints, or expansion joints constructed at required locations.

- a. Construct transverse joints in partial width or adjoining lanes to abut the same joint of adjacent lanes unless otherwise specified on the plans.
- b. Ensure that transverse joints in plain Portland cement concrete requiring load transfer devices contain either plastic-coated or epoxy-coated dowels.
- c. Before placing concrete, secure dowel bars in place with supporting assemblies.
- d. Secure the assemblies in position on the subbase to keep the dowels from moving during concrete placement.
- e. Place dowel bars to a vertical and horizontal tolerance of plus or minus 1 in. (25 mm) of the plan position. Do not misalign the dowel bar more than 3/8 in per 1 ft. (10 mm per 300 mm) in the horizontal or the vertical plane.
- f. Remove and replace dowel assemblies displaced from the Plan position more than the tolerances in Subsection 430.3.05.J.
- g. When using epoxy-coated dowels, coat the entire surface with a thin film of heavy waterproof grease.
- h. Ensure accurate positioning of transverse sawed joints by marking the position of dowel bar assembly locations.

# 5. Construction Joints

Construct transverse construction joints when interrupting concreting operations for more than one hour.

NOTE: Do not construct transverse construction joints within 10 ft (3 m) of an expansion joint, contraction joint, or transverse plane of weakness.

499

---

Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

a. Move an unanticipated construction joint back to the last plan joint, if necessary. Remove and dispose of excess concrete.

b. Form construction joints by securing in place a removable bulkhead or header board.

- 1) Place the board so that it conforms to the full cross section of the pavement. Secure it flush with the subbase and parallel to the normal transverse joints.
- 2) Slot or drill the board to allow placement of reinforcement as required by the plans.

NOTE: Do not use the roll of laitance and grout that forms in front of the paver adjacent to transverse construction joints.

c. Consolidate to full width and depth concrete adjacent to transverse construction joints with mechanical hand-type spud vibrators. Keep one auxiliary vibrator available in case of mechanical malfunctions.

d. Before applying the final finish to the concrete, string line and correct variations of the concrete surface within 30 ft. (9 m) on either side of the transverse construction joints. Provide equipment and tools such as:

- • Work bridges
- • Personnel
- • String lines
- • Straightedges
- • Lighting

e. While the concrete is in a plastic condition, stringline the surface longitudinally and correct surface deviations greater than 1/8 in. per 15 ft. (3 mm per 4.6 m) in any direction.

f. When using plain Portland cement concrete pavement, place dowel bars in construction joints. Cast half the length of each dowel bar in the concrete during each phase of joint construction.

g. When using epoxy coated dowels, coat the protruding half of each dowel bar with a thin film of heavy waterproof grease before resuming joint construction. Grease coating is not required on plastic coated dowels.

h. After the concrete has hardened, dismantle the bulkhead supporting the dowels. Do not disturb the dowels.

# 6. Contraction Joints

Create planes of weakness in plain Portland cement concrete pavement by cutting joints in the pavement surface. Create the planes according to the Plans as follows:

a. Saw transverse contraction joints before the pavement cracks. Begin sawing when the concrete has hardened enough to prevent surface raveling, usually 4 hours after placement, but no more than 24 hours.

b. Continue sawing day and night regardless of weather conditions.

# 7. Expansion Joints

Transverse expansion joints are required at locations shown on the plans.

a. Form expansion joints by securing a removable bulkhead that conforms to the full cross section of the pavement. Use bulkheads that can construct a vertical expansion wall without offsets, indentations, or burrs.

b. Use expansion joint filler required by the plans.

c. Furnish and install preformed joint filler in lengths equal to the pavement width or the width of one lane. Do not use damaged or repaired joint fillers.

d. Position the expansion joint filler vertically in the joint and at the proper grade. Use an installing bar or other device to secure the expansion joint filler at the proper grade and alignment.

Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

# L. Cure the Concrete

Immediately after finishing the concrete, cure the entire surface when the concrete will not mar. Use one or more of these methods:

# 1. Impervious Membrane Method

To use this method:

1. Spray the entire surface of the pavement with white pigmented curing compound immediately after finishing the surface and before the concrete has set. If the pavement is cured initially with cotton mats, burlap, or cotton fabric, apply the compound after removing the mats.
NOTE: Do not apply curing compound during rain.
2. Use mechanical sprayers to apply curing compound under pressure at a minimum rate of 1 gal per 150 ft² (1 L per 3.5 m²).
3. Thoroughly mix the compound with uniformly dispersed white pigments.
4. During application, use a mechanical device to stir the compound continuously.
5. Use a hand sprayer (if required) to spray odd widths, odd shapes, and concrete surfaces exposed by removing forms.
6. Do not apply curing compound to the inside faces of joints to be sealed.
7. If the membrane film becomes damaged within the curing period, repair the damaged portions immediately with additional compound.

# 2. White Polyethylene Sheeting

To use this method:

1. Cover the top surface and sides of the pavement with polyethylene sheeting. Lap the units at least 18 in. (450 mm).
2. Place the sheeting and weigh it down so that it contacts the surface.
3. Extend the sheeting beyond the edges of the slab at least twice the thickness of the pavement.
4. Unless otherwise specified, maintain the covering in place for 72 hours after placing the concrete.

# 3. Burlap, Cotton Fabric, or Other Methods

Contractors may cure the pavement with burlap, cotton fabrics, or other materials if the section remains wet for the duration specified by the Engineer.

# 4. Cold Weather Curing

To use this method:

1. Remove and replace concrete that freezes before the initial set time at no cost to the Department.
2. Use polyethylene or canvas to protect concrete that has set but is exposed to freezing temperatures within 24 hours of placement. Ensure that the internal concrete temperature is above freezing for at least 24 hours after placing the concrete.
3. Obtain approval from the Engineer to use other protection methods such as hay, straw, or grass, or to change the duration of the protection.

501

Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

# M. Seal the Joints

Clean and seal the joints according to Section 461 and the plans. Immediately after completing the curing period, fill in the joints with joint sealing material before opening the pavement to traffic. During sealing, do not spill the material on the concrete surface. Immediately remove excess material on the concrete surface and clean the surface. Do not use sand or similar material as a cover for the seal. Seal joints according to the plans.

# N. Open Pavement to Traffic

Wait to open the pavement slab to traffic, except for joint sawing vehicles, until the concrete is 14 days old unless representative compressive tests show that the slab has a compressive strength of 2,500 psi (15 MPa). Cure compressive test specimens used for traffic opening as near as possible to the roadway. Protect the pavement against traffic from the public, employees, and agents.

1. Erect and maintain barricades. Employ watchmen to block traffic from the newly constructed pavement for the period required in this specification.
2. Arrange the barriers away from public traffic on lanes remaining open.
3. Maintain signs that clearly indicate the lanes open to public traffic.
4. If traffic must go across the pavement, construct crossings satisfactory to the Engineer to bridge over the concrete. Construct the crossing without additional compensation.
5. Repair or replace pavement damaged by traffic or other causes before Final Acceptance without additional compensation. Make repairs to the Engineer’s satisfaction.

# 430.3.06 Quality Acceptance

The typical section sheet in the Plans gives specific uses for each concrete classification. Refer to this specification for the minimum requirements of the concrete classifications for concrete design approval, concrete mix design proportions, batching control responsibilities, and acceptance of hardened concrete based upon compressive strength development.

# A. Transit Mixed Concrete

Ensure that transit mixed concrete meets the requirements of Subsection 500.2, Materials.

# B. Mix Design Criteria

Proportion concrete mix designs using the following requirements:

Produce evidence that the mix design proportions for Class 1 and 2 concrete have strength development potential for 24 hours plus or minus 15 minutes and at 28 days as specified in Subsection 430.3.06.C, Approval of Mix Design Proportions.

# C. Approval of Mix Design Proportions

The Department will approve each proposed combination of materials and mix designs based on the use of approved materials, compliance with Subsection 430.3.06.B, Mix Design Criteria, and the following:

# 1. Flexural Strength

Prepare at least 9 normally cured flexural specimens and test according to AASHTO T 126 and T 97 to ensure that the demonstrated laboratory flexural design strength at 28 days meets the following minimum Design Acceptance Requirement (DAR).

NOTE: Take the 9 flexural specimens from 3 separate trial batches. Make 3 specimens from each batch.

| Class No. | Concrete DAR                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Class 1   | 600 psi + .67 s 4.1 MPa + .67 s |
| Class 2   | 700 psi + .50 s 4.8 MPa + .50 s |
| Class HES | 700 psi + .50 s 4.8 MPa + .50 s |

s = a standard deviation of all 28-day flexural specimens for a given combination of materials and mix proportions prepared together. Do not use a value of “s” greater than 37 psi (255 kPa) to calculate DAR.

# 2. Compressive Strength

Prepare and test at least 6 cylinders according to AASHTO T 126 and T 22 to ensure that the demonstrated laboratory compressive strength at 28 days for Class 1 and 2 concrete exceeds the minimum Job Performance Value (JPV). Produce similar evidence that demonstrates strength development at 72 hours for Class HES concrete.

| Class     | Concrete JPV Minimum             |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Class 1   | 3,000 psi + .18 R 20 MPa + .18 R |
| Class 2   | 3,500 psi + .21 R 25 MPa + .21 R |
| Class HES | 3,000 psi + .05 R 20 MPa + .05 R |

R = the difference between the largest observed value and the smallest observed value for all compressive strength specimens at 28 days for a combination of materials and mix proportions prepared together.

Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

1. Class 1 and 2 Concrete
1. Submit early compressive strength test results made at 24 hours plus or minus 30 minutes for at least 12 cylinders. Prepare and test according to ASTM C 684, Method A.
2. Prepare cylinders from three separate trial batches and make four specimens from each batch.
3. Determine the average strength, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for the design according to ACI 214. Do not use designs that produce a coefficient variation greater than 10 percent.
2. Class HES Concrete
Submit evidence that designs proposed for use as Class HES concrete have compressive strength development potential at 72 hours of 3,000 psi (20 MPa) plus .05 R.

# D. Field Adjustments on Concrete Mixes

Determine the aggregate surface moisture and apply free moisture corrections to the approved mix design. The Engineer will verify that the corrections are made properly. Adjust the approved proportions of the fine and coarse aggregate and water as desired, provided:

1. The cement factor is not decreased.
2. The water-cement ratio is not increased.
3. Adjustments produce concrete proportions according to this Specification.
4. The Engineer is notified before use.

# E. Concrete Mix Tolerances

Keep concrete consistency and air content to vary within the following limits:

1. Consistency
Immediately before placement, use GDT 27 to determine concrete slump. Do not use concrete for Portland cement concrete pavement with a slump value greater than 2.5 in. (65 mm).
2. Air Content
Immediately before placement, use GDT 26, GDT 28, or GDT 32 to determine the air content of the concrete. Concrete will not be accepted that has an air content outside of these limits:

| Lower acceptance limit | 3.0% |
| ---------------------- | ---- |
| Upper acceptance limit | 6.5% |

# F. Concrete Strength Acceptance

The concrete strength of Portland cement concrete pavement is accepted based upon development of compressive strength at a specific time. Strength development is determined by a lot acceptance plan. The pavement is subdivided into separate concrete lots of approximately 5,334 yd² (4400 m²) placed continuously, except for required work stoppages.

1. Ramps
Ramps may be set apart as individual lots. Include acceleration or deceleration lanes, wedges, or other varied width sections in other lots if the total paving quantity is not greater than 7,500 yd² (6300 m²). The Engineer will randomly select three production units from each lot for strength determination tests.

504

---

# Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

# 2. Class 1 and 2 Concrete

a. Cast at least two cylinder sets for each production unit selected for acceptance testing. Cure one set according to ASTM C-684, Method A. Cure the other set according to AASHTO T 23.

NOTE: A set is defined as two 6 by 12 inch (150 by 300 mm) or three 4 by 8 inch (100 by 200 mm) cylinders.

b. After curing, test each concrete cylinder according to AASHTO T 22. The test result is the average strength of the two cylinders.

# 3. Acceptance Based on 24-Hour Strength

Concrete may be accepted by early strength determinations. However, concrete will not be accepted based on early strength development when the difference between the largest observed strength value and the smallest observed strength value exceeds 35 percent of the average.

a. Compute the average (X) and the range (R) from the three acceptance tests results.

b. Have the Engineer establish the minimum early strength (S) to be used for concrete acceptance. The minimum early acceptance strength is the average strength at 24 hours plus or minus 30 minutes of the laboratory design less 1.5 times the standard deviation of the laboratory design.

c. If the average (X) of the three lot acceptance tests equal or exceed the value (S), the lot will be accepted at the full contract price, and 28-day cylinders for this lot can be discarded.

d. If the average of the three lot acceptance tests fails to meet the acceptance limit, the Engineer will contact the Contractor immediately. The Contractor may immediately remove the concrete in the lot or leave it in place pending acceptance or rejection from the 28-day strength test results.

# 4. Acceptance Based on 28-Day Strength Tests

When a lot is potentially defective based on the early strength determinations and the Contractor leaves the lot in place to be judged by the 28-day strength tests results, retain and cure all 3 sets of 28-day cylinders.

a. If the average 28-day strength of the lot does not meet the lower acceptance limit for a 0.70 pay factor, the Engineer may either:

- Order removal of the concrete in the lot
- Apply a pay factor of 0.50 for the lot

b. The Unit Price of concrete pavement will be reduced for areas represented by each lot that does not meet the specified compressive strength at 28 days according to the following schedule:

| Pay Factor Schedule for Strength Determinations at 28 Days |                             |                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Acceptance Limits for Pay Factor Levels                    |                             |                             |
| 1.00 LAL\*                                                 | 0.95 LAL                    | 0.70 LAL                    |
| Concrete Class 1                                           | 3,000 psi (20 MPa) + 0.18 R | 3,000 psi (20 MPa) - 0.07 R |
| Concrete Class 2                                           | 3,500 psi (25 MPa) + 0.21 R | 3,500 psi (25 MPa) - 0.07 R |
|                                                            | 3,500 psi (25 MPa) - 0.30 R |                             |

Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

5. Classification HES Concrete

- Cast at least two sets of cylinders for each production unit selected for acceptance testing.
- a. Cure one set for 72 hours under conditions similar to those under which the pavement is cured. Cure the other set of cylinders for 28 days according to AASHTO T 23.
- b. Test each cylinder according to AASHTO T 22 when the specified curing is complete. The test results are the average strength of the two cylinders.
- c. The Engineer may accept the concrete at full contract price if the average of the three 72-hour test results exceeds the JPV established in Subsection 430.3.06.C.
- d. When the 72-hour strength tests determine that a lot is potentially defective, the Engineer will immediately notify the Contractor. At this time, the Engineer may require the immediate removal of the pavement in question. If the Engineer does not require immediate removal of the pavement, select removal or acceptance on the basis of the 28-day strength development.
- e. When the 72-hour strength tests determine that a lot is potentially defective and the concrete is retained for subsequent judgment, conduct acceptance tests at 28 days on selected cylinders cured according to AASHTO T 23. Questionable lots will be accepted based on the 28-day strength and provisions for testing, computations, and payment for Classification No. 2 concrete in Subsection 430.3.06.F.2, Class 1 and 2 Concrete.

G. Smoothness

Pavement smoothness will be accepted only after the Engineer determines that the work was performed according to this and other specifications. The completed pavement, including corrective work, must meet the applicable profile index value requirements.

Perform smoothness testing as follows:

1. Ensure that the mainline riding surface produces a profile index value no greater than 7 in./mile (100 mm/km) on each travel lane. Conduct tests according to GDT 78.
2. Determine a profile index value for each tracing for each 0.25-mile (0.5 km) segment. Correct individual bumps or depressions that exceed the blanking band by more than 0.2 in. (5 mm) at no additional expense to the Department.
3. If a paving operation exceeds a profile index value of 7 in./mile (100 mm/km) per lane for any segment, suspend the paving operation and take corrective action approved by the Engineer.
4. Use GDT 78 to test ramps and acceleration and deceleration lanes to attain an average profile index value no greater than 12 in./mile (200 mm/km) by Rainhart Profilograph for the entire section length. Correct individual bumps or depressions that exceed 0.2 in. (5 mm) from the blanking band at no additional expense to the Department.
5. Take pavement profiles that are 4 ft. (1.2 m) away from and parallel to the new pavement edges on pavements greater than 16 ft. (4.8 m) wide and up to 24 ft. (7.2 m) wide. Test pavement 6 to 16 ft. (1.8 to 4.8 m) wide parallel to and at the center line of the pavement section.
6. Begin the 0.25-mile (0.5 km) record segments at the first day’s placement and continue until project completion, except as noted in this specification.
7. Combine pavement sections less than 700 ft. (200 m) long that approach a bridge. Use the previous 0.25-mile (0.5 km) segment to determine the profile index. Calculate as a separate record segment 700 ft. (200 m) sections or greater that approach a bridge. This exception applies also to sections at project limits.

506

Section 430 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

1. Determine a separate profile index value using GDT 78 for the 100 ft. (30 m) of roadway approaching each end of a bridge up to and including the joint with the approach slab. Average the profile index from the right and left wheel paths for each 100 ft. (30 m) segment for each lane for each approach. The average profile index value shall not exceed 30 in./mile (500 mm/km).
2. Before paving farther, perform and evaluate profiles from the first day’s placement.

After completing and evaluating this test run, adjust equipment as required by the Engineer to improve smoothness before paving continues.
3. Complete the report form furnished by the Engineer and attach to the profilograph tracings of each day. Include the following information in each trace:
- Project number
- Beginning and ending station numbers
- 500 ft. (150 m) paving stations
- Traffic direction
- Lane number
- Date paved and tested
- Construction joint locations

Have the certified profilograph operator obtain and evaluate the traces and submit the evaluation to the Engineer. Provide results no later than the end of the second work day following placement.

For mainline pavement, correct 0.25 mile (0.5 km) segments not meeting the profile index requirement using one of these methods:

Grind the entire lane surface of the 0.25-mile (0.5 km) segment to a profile index value less than 7 in./mile (100 mm/km). Use equipment that meets requirements in Section 431.

Grind roughness in small segment areas no more than 50 ft. (15 m) of full lane width to produce a profile index value no greater than 7 in./mile (100 mm/km). If more than 50 ft. (15 m) of grinding is required, grind the complete 0.25-mile (0.5 km) segment according to Method a, above.

Correct ramps and acceleration and deceleration lanes that do not meet the profile index requirement to a profile index no greater than 12 in./mile (200 mm/km). Prevent individual bumps from exceeding 0.2 in. (5 mm) from the blanking band. Use equipment specified in Section 431.

Correct 100 ft. (30 m) bridge approach sections that do not meet the profile index requirement.

Grind according to Section 431.
If appropriate, use a bump grinder to correct bumps with a baseline of 5 ft. (1.5 m) or less.
Grind the full lane width even when grinding including individual bumps.
Retest pavement segments containing corrective slab replacements for Final Acceptance.

Correct segments that do not meet the profile index criteria of this specification at no additional expense to the Department. Retest segments after correction with the Rainhart Profilograph.

Notify the Engineer before profile testing. The Engineer will verify the results by randomly selecting a minimum of 1 out of every 10 consecutive record segment profiles to compute the profile index and to compare with Contractor results. The Engineer may conduct profilograph tests at any time to verify Contractor results. The Department may test record segments if the Engineer determines that the Contractor test results are inaccurate. See Subsection 430.5.01, Adjustments.

# H. Thickness

The Engineer shall determine the pavement thickness using average core measurements tested according to GDT 31.

Section 431 — Grind Concrete Pavement

# 431.3.02 Equipment

# A. Grinding Equipment

Use power driven, self-propelled grinding equipment with these characteristics:

- Diamond blades designed to smooth and texture Portland Cement concrete pavement
- Effective wheel base of at least 12 ft. (3.6 m)
- Pivoting tandem bogey wheels at the front of the machine
- Rear wheels arranged to travel in the track of the freshly cut pavement
- Grinding head with the center no further than 3 ft. (900 mm) forward from the center of the back wheels

Ensure that the equipment:

- Cuts or planes at least 3 ft. (900 mm) wide
- Operates without encroaching on traffic movement outside the work area
- Grinds the surface without causing spalls at cracks, joints, or other locations

Periodically check the equipment to ensure that it is in proper working order, especially the wheel “roundness” on the grinding equipment. Immediately correct “out-of-round” wheels.

# B. Rainhart Profilograph

Use the Rainhart Profilograph to test ground pavement surfaces on ramps, acceleration and deceleration lanes, and other areas not suitable for testing with the Road Profiler for Pavement Profile Index value.

# 431.3.03 Preparation

Complete spall repairs, slab replacements, and pressure grouting in the area to be ground before beginning grinding operations.

# 431.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 431.3.05 Construction

Grind the pavement surface areas designated on the plans. Only grind bridge decks and roadway shoulders when they are indicated on the Plans, required to promote drainage, or required to conform to smoothness requirements if the work is new construction or bridge decks.

Grind the surface areas as follows:

1. Schedule the construction operation to produce a uniform finished surface.
2. Maintain a constant cross slope between grinding extremities in each lane to ensure that grinding provides positive lateral drainage.
3. Transition auxiliary or ramp lane grinding from the mainline edge and at the end of the cut to provide positive drainage and acceptable riding surface.
4. Grind the entire area designated on the plans until the pavement surfaces of the adjacent sides of transverse joints and cracks are in the same plane.
5. Eliminate the faulting at joints and cracks and ensure that the overall riding characteristics are within the limits specified.
6. Texture the pavement surface, but do not grind extra depth to eliminate minor depressions.
7. Remove grinding residue before it is blown by traffic action or wind. Do not allow residue to flow into gutters, drainage facilities, or across lanes used by public traffic.
8. Ensure that the operation produces pavement that conforms to the typical cross section and requirements in Subsection 431.3.06, Quality Acceptance.

---


# Section 431 — Grind Concrete Pavement

# 431.3.06 Quality Acceptance

Produce a pavement surface that is true to grade and uniform with a longitudinal line-type texture.

# A. Texture

Ensure that the line-type texture contains corrugations that are parallel to the outside pavement edge and have a narrow ridge corduroy-type appearance.

# B. Grooves

Ensure that the peaks of the ridges are 1/16 in., ± 1/32 in. (1.6 mm, ± 0.8 mm) higher than the bottoms of the grooves with 57 to 60 (185 to 200) evenly spaced grooves per foot (meter). Select the number of grooves per foot (meter) to produce the surface finish for each aggregate type that is in the concrete surface on the project. Groove spacing that does not meet the specified surface finish will not be accepted.

# C. Finished Pavement Surface

Correct deficiencies in the final surface finish from improper operation or equipment at no expense to the Department. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Pavement corrugation due to “out of round” wheels on grinding equipment
- Improper cutting head operations that cause the head to ride in and out of the pavement when encountering light and heavy cuts
- Depressions created from improper starting and stopping during the cutting operation
- Unground ridges left in the pavement from defective blades in the grinding head

Closely check the ground pavement surface during grinding and take corrective action if any of the above deficiencies occur. The finished pavement surface will be measured for riding quality using the Laser Road Profiler according to test procedure GDT 126.

Follow these requirements to ensure that the grinding produces an acceptable riding surface:

1. Ensure that the ground pavement surfaces on the mainline meet a pavement ride index value not exceeding 900 on each 0.25-mile segment (0.5 km segment) for each vehicle lane.
2. Conduct tests according to GDT 126. Calculate and report smoothness values for each 0.25-mile (0.5 km) section of each vehicle lane.
3. Regrind areas that do not meet the smoothness requirements at no additional cost to the Department.

# D. Regrinding

To regrind areas to meet the smoothness or final surface finish:

1. Regrind the entire lane width in the area to be corrected. Regrind of just a portion of the lane width will not be permitted.
2. Perform spot regrinding on moderate to major deviations throughout the deficient 0.25-mile (0.5 km) section of the lane to meet the smoothness and final surface finish requirements. Spot regrinding of just the largest deviations of a portion of the deficient 0.25-mile (0.5 km) lane section will not be permitted.

The Engineer may require profilograph traces before regrinding to locate deviations within a failed area. The Department will perform profilograph testing according to GDT 78. Provide traffic control for profilograph testing at no cost to the Department.

The Engineer may require profilograph testing of ground surfaces on the mainline that meet the smoothness requirements. Testing will be performed according to GDT 78 to isolate locations with individual bumps or depressions greater than 0.20 in. (5 mm) outside the blanking band. Perform corrective grinding to eliminate these bumps or depressions at no additional cost to the Department.

# Section 431 — Grind Concrete Pavement

Ensure that the Pavement Profile Index value readings on ramps, acceleration and deceleration lanes, and other areas not suitable for Road Profiler testing do not exceed 7 in./mile (100 mm/km) when tested in accordance with GDT 78. If they are exceeded:

- Regrind the areas that exceed this value at no additional cost to the Department.
- Regrind individual bumps or depressions greater than 0.20 in. (5 mm) outside the blanking band on the profilograph trace at no additional cost to the Department.

Inspect transverse joints and random cracks to ensure that adjacent surfaces are in the same plane. Grind surface misalignments greater than 1/16 in. (2 mm) of the surface planes on adjacent sides of the joints or cracks until the surfaces are flush.

# E. Pavement Transverse Slope

Ensure that the pavement transverse slope is uniform and that depressions or slope misalignments are not greater than 1/8 in. in 12 ft. (3 mm in 3.6 m) when tested with a straightedge placed perpendicular to the centerline.

1. Minimize vertical alignment mismatches between adjacent cuts, 1/16 in. (2 mm) maximum.
2. Check the transverse slope closely as the work progresses. Correct mismatches immediately.
3. If one or more lanes are not to be ground, ensure that the vertical interface edge between the ground and unground lanes is not misaligned more than 1/8 in. (3 mm). Feather the cut from the ground lanes into the unground lanes to meet this requirement.

Place the temporary tie-in at taper rate of at least 6 to 1 horizontal to vertical distance.

g. Remove dust, residue, and loose milled material from the micro-milled surface. Do not allow traffic on the milled surface and do not place asphaltic concrete on the milled surface until removal is complete.

# 432.3.06 Milling Quality Acceptance

# A. Conventional Milling Acceptance Criteria

Ensure that the milling operation produces a uniform pavement texture that is true to line, grade, and cross-section.

Milled pavement surface acceptance testing will be performed using the Laser Road Profiler method in GDT 126.

Milled pavement will be evaluated on individual test sections, normally 1 mile (1 km) long.

When the milled surface is to be left as the final wearing surface, ensure that indices do not exceed:

- 1025 on milled pavement surfaces on interstates when the milled surface will be the final wearing surface
- 1175 for other on-system routes when the milled surface will be the final wearing surface
- 1175 on Interstates and 1325 for other on-system routes if the milled surface will be overlaid

Remill mile (kilometer) areas to meet the specified limits when the indices are exceeded. Remill at no additional cost to the Department.

Milled pavement surfaces are subject to visual and straightedge inspection. Keep a 10 ft. (3 m) straightedge near the milling operation to measure surface irregularities of the milled pavement surface. Remill irregularities greater than 1/8 in. per 10 ft. (3 mm in 3 m) at no additional cost to the Department.

Ensure that the cross slope is uniform and that no depressions or slope misalignments greater than 1/4 in. per 12 ft. (6 mm in 3.6 m) exist when the slope is tested with a straightedge placed perpendicular to the center line.

Ensure the micro-milling operation produces a uniform pavement texture true to line, grade, and cross section.

Micro-mill additional depth to eliminate excessive scabbing of the in place material as directed by the Engineer.

Micro-milled pavement surface acceptance testing will be performed using the Laser Road Profiler method in GDT 126.

Micro-milled pavement will be evaluated on individual test sections, measuring 0.50 mile (0.50 km). Ensure micro-milled pavement meets specified measured tolerances for RVD and profile surface smoothness indices of Target 825 mm/km and not exceed the Correction index of 900 mm/km.

- Micro-milled pavement surfaces are subject to visual and straightedge inspections. Ensure a 10 ft. (3 m) straightedge is kept at the micro-milling operation to measure surface irregularities of the milled pavement surface.
- Any areas exceeding 1/8 in. (3.2 mm) between the ridge and valley of the mat surface or fail to meet pavement surface acceptance testing using the Laser Road Profiler shall subject the micro-milled surface to a pay reduction of 20% based on the micro-milling unit cost per square yd. at the recommendation of the Office of Materials and Testing.
- Any areas exceeding 3/16 in. (4.8 mm) between the ridge and valley of the mat surface or fail to meet pavement surface acceptance testing using the Laser Road Profiler shall subject the locations to being removed and replaced with acceptable material as directed by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department. All corrective work shall be performed in a minimum 500 ft. section.
- Ensure the cross slope is uniform and no depressions or slope misalignments greater than 1/4 in. per 12 ft. (6 mm in 3.6 m) exist when the slope is tested with a straightedge placed perpendicular to the center line.

# Section 439 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (Special)

1. When placing slabs continuously across transverse contraction joint locations, use saw-cuts to provide planes of weakness according to the requirements of this Specification and the GDOT construction standard for contraction joints.
2. Seal the joints according to the Plans.

# Determine Types of Joints

1. Longitudinal Joints
Longitudinal joints shall contain unpainted and uncoated deformed steel bars that are the size and length specified on the Plans. Place the bars perpendicular to the joint using a mechanical device, or rigidly secure the bars in place with supports.
2. Longitudinal Formed Joints
Construct longitudinal formed joints while the concrete is in a plastic state. Use methods and equipment that locates the joint reinforcement properly without disrupting it during construction.
3. Longitudinal Sawed Joints
Cut longitudinal sawed joints with a mechanical saw within three days after the concrete is placed and before traffic or equipment enters the pavement.
4. Transverse Joints
Transverse joints consist of construction joints, contraction joints, or expansion joints constructed at required locations.

1. Construct transverse joints in partial width or adjoining lanes to abut the same joint of adjacent lanes unless otherwise specified on the Plans.
2. Ensure that transverse joints in plain Portland Cement concrete requiring load transfer devices contain either plastic-coated or epoxy-coated dowels.
3. Before placing concrete, secure dowel bars in place with supporting assemblies.
4. Secure the assemblies in position on the subbase to keep the dowels from moving during concrete placement.
5. Place dowel bars to a vertical and horizontal tolerance of ± 1 in. (± 25 mm) of the Plan position. Do not misalign the dowel bar more than 3/8 in. per foot (10 mm per 300 mm) in the horizontal or vertical plane.
6. Remove and replace dowel assemblies displaced from the Plan position more than the tolerances in Subsection 430.3.05.J, Provide Joints.
7. When using epoxy-coated dowels, coat the entire surface with a thin film of heavy waterproof grease.
8. Ensure accurate positioning of transverse sawed joints by marking the position of dowel bar assembly locations.

Section 439 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (Special)

# 5. Construction Joints

Construct transverse construction joints when interrupting concreting operations for more than one hour.

NOTE: Do not construct transverse construction joints within 10 ft. (3 m) of an expansion joint, contraction joint, or transverse plane of weakness.

1. Move an unanticipated construction joint back to the last Plan joint and remove and dispose of excess concrete.
2. Form construction joints by securing in place a removable bulkhead or header board.
1. Place the board so that it conforms to the full cross section of the pavement. Secure it flush with the subbase and parallel to the normal transverse joints.
2. Slot or drill the board to allow placement of reinforcement as required by the Plans.
NOTE: Do not use the roll of laitance and grout that forms in front of the paver adjacent to transverse construction joints.
3. Consolidate to full width and depth concrete adjacent to transverse construction joints with mechanical hand-type spud vibrators. Keep one auxiliary vibrator available in case of mechanical malfunctions.
4. Before applying the final finish to the concrete, stringline and correct variations of the concrete surface within 30 ft. (9 m) on either side of the transverse construction joints. Provide equipment and tools such as:
- Work bridges
- Personnel
- String lines
- Straightedges
- Lighting
5. While the concrete is in a plastic condition, stringline the surface longitudinally and correct surface deviations greater than 1/8 in. in 15 ft. (3 mm in 4.6 m) in any direction.
6. When using Plain Portland cement concrete pavement, place dowel bars in construction joints. Cast half the length of each dowel bar in the concrete during each phase of joint construction.
7. After the concrete has hardened, dismantle the bulkhead supporting the dowels. Do not disturb the dowels.
8. When using epoxy coated dowels, coat the protruding half of each dowel bar with a thin film of heavy waterproof grease before resuming joint construction. Grease coating is not required on plastic coated dowels.

# 6. Contraction Joints

Create planes of weakness in plain Portland cement concrete pavement by cutting joints in the pavement surface. Create the planes according to the Plans and as follows:

1. Saw transverse contraction joints before the pavement cracks. Begin sawing when the concrete has hardened enough to prevent surface raveling, usually 4 hours after placement but no more than 24 hours.
2. Continue sawing day and night regardless of weather conditions.

Section 439 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (Special)

# 7. Expansion Joints

Transverse expansion joints are required at locations shown on the Plans.

1. Form expansion joints by securing a removable bulkhead that conforms to the full cross section of the pavement. Use bulkheads that can construct a vertical expansion wall without offsets, indentations, or burrs.
2. Use expansion joint filler required by the Plans.
3. Furnish and install preformed joint filler in lengths equal to the pavement width or the width of one lane. Do not use damaged or repaired joint fillers.
4. Position the expansion joint filler vertically in the joint and at the proper grade. Use an installing bar or other device to secure the expansion joint filler at the proper grade and alignment.

# I. Seal the Joints

Clean and seal the joints according to Section 461 and the Plans. Immediately after completing the curing period, fill in the joints with joint sealing material before opening the pavement to traffic.

# J. Cure the Concrete

Immediately after finishing the concrete, cure the entire surface when the concrete will not mar. Use one or more of these methods:

1. Impervious Membrane Method
1. To use this method:
1. Spray the entire surface of the pavement with white pigmented curing compound immediately after finishing the surface and before the concrete has set. If the pavement is cured initially with cotton mats, burlap, or cotton fabric, apply the compound after removing the mats.
2. NOTE: Do not apply curing compound during rain.
3. Use mechanical sprayers to apply curing compound under pressure at a minimum rate of 1 gal per 150 ft.² (1 L per 3.5 m²). Use fully atomizing spraying equipment that is equipped with a tank agitator.
4. Thoroughly mix the curing compound immediately before use.
5. During application, use a mechanical device to stir the compound continuously.
6. If required, use a hand sprayer to spray odd widths, odd shapes, and concrete surfaces exposed by removing forms.
7. Do not apply curing compound to the inside faces of joints to be sealed.
8. If the membrane film becomes damaged within the curing period, repair the damaged portions immediately with additional compound.
2. White Polyethylene Sheeting
1. To use this method:
1. Cover the top surface and sides of the pavement with polyethylene sheeting. Lap the units at least 18 in (450 mm).
2. Place the sheeting and weigh it down so that it contacts the surface.
3. Extend the sheeting beyond the edges of the slab at least twice the thickness of the pavement.
4. Unless otherwise specified, maintain the covering in place for 72 hours after placing the concrete.

547

# Section 439 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (Special)

# 3. Burlap, Cotton Fabric, or Other Methods

Contractors may cure the pavement surface with burlap, cotton fabrics, or other materials if the section remains wet for the duration specified by the Engineer.

# 4. Cold Weather Curing

To use this method:

- a. Remove and replace concrete that freezes before the initial set time at no additional cost to the Department.
- b. Use polyethylene or canvas to protect concrete that has set but is exposed to freezing temperatures within 24 hours of placement. Ensure that the internal concrete temperature is above freezing for at least 24 hours after placing the concrete.
- c. Obtain approval from the Engineer to use other protection methods such as hay, straw, or grass, or to change the duration of the protection.

# K. Open Pavement to Traffic

Wait to open the pavement slab to traffic, except for joint sawing vehicles, until the concrete is 14 days old unless representative compressive tests show that the slab has a compressive strength of 2,500 psi (15 MPa). Prevent pavement slab stress by constructing a ramp of compacted earth or other material to move on and off the pavement. Do not allow equipment that exceeds legal load limits on the pavement. Protect the pavement against traffic from the public, employees, and agents.

1. Erect and maintain barricades. Employ watchmen to block traffic from the newly constructed pavement for the period required in this Specification.
2. Arrange the barriers away from public traffic on lanes remaining open.
3. Maintain signs that clearly indicate the lanes open to public traffic.
4. If traffic must go across the pavement, construct crossings satisfactory to the Engineer to bridge over the concrete. Construct the crossing without additional compensation.
5. Repair or replace pavement damaged by traffic or other causes before Final Acceptance without additional compensation. Make repairs to the Engineer’s satisfaction.

# 439.3.06 Quality Acceptance

The typical section sheet in the Plans specifies concrete classifications for specific uses. This Specification establishes minimum requirements for these concrete classifications for concrete design approval, concrete mix design proportions, batching control responsibilities, and acceptance of hardened concrete based upon compressive strength development.

Produce Portland cement concrete by combining proportions of approved materials in batches according to the construction methods specified in this Specification. Mix concrete produced in a stationary central mix plant for at least 60 seconds after the materials enter the drum. Mix time may be reduced if the representative tests show that the concrete meets requirements of ASTM C 94, Requirements for Uniformity. Never mix less than 50 seconds.

# A. Transit Mixed Concrete

Ensure that transit mixed concrete meets the requirements of Subsection 500.3.04.E.3, Transit-Mixed Concrete.

# B. Mix Design Criteria

# Section 439 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (Special)

# J. Smoothness Profile

Include in the Contract Unit Bid Price the cost to furnish and operate a Rainhart (Model 860) Profilograph to measure pavement profile deviations. Measure and correct pavement profile deviations as follows:

1. Ensure that the mainline riding surface produces a profile index value no greater than 7 in./mile (100 mm/km) on each travel lane. Conduct tests according to GDT 78. Determine a profile index value for each tracing in each ¼ mile (0.5 km) segment.
2. Correct individual bumps or depressions that exceed the blanking band by more than 0.2 in. (5 mm) at no additional expense to the Department.
3. Suspend paving operations if a profile index value exceeds 7 in./mile (100 mm/km) per lane for any segment. Take corrective action approved by the Engineer.
4. Test ramps, acceleration lanes, and deceleration lanes using GDT 78 to ensure that the average profile index value does not exceed 12 in./mile (200 mm/km) for the entire section length.
5. Correct individual bumps or depressions that exceed 0.2 in (5 mm) from the blanking band at no additional expense to the Department.
6. Take pavement profiles 4 ft. (1.2 m) from and parallel to the new pavement edges for pavements greater than 16 ft. (4.8 m) wide and up to 24 ft. (7.2 m) wide. Test pavement 6 to 16 ft. (1.8 to 4.8 m) wide parallel to and at the center line of the pavement section.
7. Begin the 0.25 mile (0.5 km) record segments at the first day’s placement and continue until project completion, except as noted in this Specification. Combine pavement sections less than 650 ft. (200 m) approaching a bridge with the previous 0.25 mile (0.5 km) segment to determine the profile index.
8. Calculate as separate record segment sections 650 ft. (200 m) or greater approaching a bridge and sections at Project limits.
9. Determine a separate profile index value according to GDT 78 for the 100 ft. (30 m) of roadway approaching each end of a bridge, up to and including the joint with the approach slab. Average the profile index from the right and left wheelpaths for each 100 ft. (30 m) segment for each lane for each approach. Ensure that the average profile index value is no greater than 30 in./mile (500 mm/km).
10. Notify the Engineer before profile testing. The Engineer will verify the results by randomly selecting at least 1 out of every 10 consecutive record segment profiles to compute the profile index and to compare with Contractor results.

# K. Pavement Tolerances

For Projects that include weigh-in-motion truck scales, follow these pavement tolerances:

1. Ensure that the Rainhart Profilograph readings do not exceed 5 in/mile (80 mm/km) in the 600 ft. (180 m) approach to the scales and the 200 ft. (60 m) beyond the scales.
2. Ensure that the rolling straightedge measurements show no deviation greater than 1/16 in. (2 mm) within 10 ft. (3 m).



---


# Section 439 — Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (Special)

# L. Smoothness Testing

Perform smoothness testing as follows:

1. Perform and evaluate profiles from the first day of placement before continuing paving. When the test run is complete and evaluated, the Engineer may require equipment adjustments to improve smoothness before paving continues.
2. Complete the report form furnished by the Engineer, and attach it to each day’s profilograph tracings. Include the following information in each trace:
- Project number
- Beginning and ending station numbers
- 500 ft. (150 m) paving stations
- Traffic direction
- Lane number
- Date paved and tested
- Construction joint locations
3. Have the certified profilograph operator obtain and evaluate traces to be submitted to the Engineer. Provide results no later than the end of the second work day following placement.
4. For mainline pavement, correct 0.25 mile (0.5 km) segments that do not meet the profile index requirement by using one of these methods:

Grind the entire lane surface of the 0.25 mile (0.5 km) segment to a profile index value no greater than 7 in./mile (100 mm/km). Use equipment that meets the requirements in Section 431.
5. Grind roughness in small segment areas no more than 50 ft. (15 m) of full lane width to produce a profile index value no greater than 7 in./mile (100 mm/km). If more than 50 ft. (15 m) of grinding is required, grind the complete 0.25 mile (0.5 km) segment according to Method a, above.

Correct ramps and acceleration and deceleration lanes that do not meet the profile index requirement to a profile index no greater than 12 in./mile (200 mm/km). Prevent individual bumps from exceeding 0.2 in. (5 mm) from the blanking band. Use equipment specified in Section 431.
Correct 100 ft. (30 m) bridge approach sections that do not meet the profile index requirement.

Grind according to Section 431.
Use a bump grinder to correct bumps with a baseline of 5 ft. (1.5 m) or less.
Grind the full lane width even when grinding individual bumps.
Retest pavement segments containing corrective slab replacements for Final Acceptance.

Correct segments that do not meet the profile index criteria of this Specification at no additional expense to the Department. Retest segments after correction with the Rainhart Profilograph as specified.
The Engineer may conduct profilograph tests at any time to verify Contractor results. The Department may test record segments if the Engineer determines that the Contractor test results are inaccurate. If this occurs, see Subsection 439.5.01, Adjustments.

# M. Acceptance

Pavement smoothness will be accepted when:

- The Engineer determines that the work was satisfactorily performed according to the Specifications.
- The completed pavement, including corrective Work, meets the applicable profile index value requirements.

1. Deposit the concrete on the grade; do not re-handle it if possible.
2. Unless truck mixers, truck agitators, or non-agitating hauling equipment are equipped to discharge concrete without segregation, concrete shall be unloaded into an approved spreading device and mechanically spread on grade.
3. Place it continuously between transverse joints without using the intermediate bulkheads.
4. Perform any necessary hand spreading with shovels.

NOTE: Do not allow personnel to walk in freshly mixed concrete with shoes coated with harmful substances.

Thoroughly consolidate with vibration the concrete against and along the form faces and along the full length and both sides of joint assemblies.
Do not continue vibration if puddling or excessive grout accumulates on the surface.

NOTE: Do not use grout that accumulates ahead of the paver in construction or expansion joints.

Deposit concrete near formed joints. Do not dump or discharge concrete onto a joint assembly unless the concrete is centered on the joint assembly.

# B. Placing Reinforcement

Place the reinforcement according to details on the Plans. Do not allow reinforcement placement to disrupt or damage the concrete. Do not insert lane tie bars into unsupported sides of fresh concrete.

# C. Achieving Consolidation

Vibrate the full width and depth of the shoulder. Do not allow the vibrators to contact the foundation, load transfer devices, side forms, or joints. If the vibrator does not produce uniform consolidation and density, stop the operation to furnish methods or equipment that will produce pavement according to the Specifications.

B. Repairing Potholes, Spalls, or Cracks

Before placing the fabric, repair potholes, spalls, or cracks greater than 3/16 in (5 mm) wide. Repair spalls and potholes using asphaltic concrete that meets the requirements of Section 400 or other materials such as cold mixes approved by the Engineer. Fill cracks with PG 64-22 asphalt cement or other materials approved by the Engineer.

# 446.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 446.3.05 Construction

Do not install reinforcement fabric when ambient temperatures are less than 45 °F (7 ºC). Use a bituminous tack coat when temperatures are between 45°F (7 ºC) and 70°F (21ºC) for all reinforcement fabric types. When ambient temperatures are a minimum of 70 °F (21 ºC) and rising, reinforcement fabric with a self-adhesive backing may be installed at the Contractor’s option without applying a bituminous tack coat except when the fabric is placed on a milled surface. Use a bituminous tack coat when fabric is placed on a milled surface regardless of the temperature.

A. Applying Bituminous Binder

Use a bituminous tack coat to bond self-adhesive fabric to the pavement and apply the bituminous tack coat at a rate of 0.10 gal/yd² (0.45 L/m²) over non-milled surfaces and 0.20 gal/yd² (0.90 L/m²) over milled surfaces. Heat the bituminous tack coat and apply within a temperature range of 350 °F to 375 °F (175 ºC to 190 ºC). Use bituminous tack coat to bond non-self-adhesive fabric to the pavement and apply at a rate of 0.10 gal/yd² (0.45 L/m²) over non-milled surfaces and 0.25 gal/yd² (1.13 L/m²) over milled surfaces. Heat the bituminous tack coat and apply within a temperature range of 350 °F to 375 °F (175 ºC to 190 ºC). Where using fabric strips, use a template or other method satisfactory to the Engineer to apply bituminous tack coat uniformly. Do not allow the width of the bituminous tack coat applied to exceed the width of the fabric by more than 1 in. (25 mm) on each side.

B. Placing the Fabric

For self-adhesive reinforcement fabric, remove the release liner of the fabric and place the adhesive side to the pavement. Place self-adhesive reinforcement fabric no more than 24 hours in advance of the paving operation to ensure proper adhesion of the fabric to the pavement. Place non-self-adhesive reinforcement fabric at least 1 hour but no more than 24 hours in advance of the paving operation to ensure proper adhesion of the fabric to the pavement. Place fabric on the pavement immediately after the bituminous tack coat has been applied to the pavement. Place the non-woven polyester side of the fabric on the pavement. Install the fabric so that it is smooth, free of wrinkles with no uplifted edges. Provide a minimum of 5 in. (125 mm) overlap on all sides of the repair area. Center the material over the repair area within a 2 in. (50 mm) tolerance. When placed full width, use a mechanical device approved by the engineer to place the fabric on the pavement. Immediately after the fabric is placed on the pavement, ensure that the fabric is in total contact with the underlying pavement. Roll the material with a static drum or pneumatic roller to ensure adequate adhesion to the pavement surface. Any fabric with loose edges, corners or other improperly bonded areas shall be replaced at the expense of the Contractor prior to placement of the overlay or opening the fabric section to traffic.

577

---

Section 446 — Placement of Pavement Reinforcement Fabric

C. Overlapping Fabric

If more than one strip of fabric is required to cover the repair area, the seams that are created shall be butt or lapped seams. When waterproofing is required, use lap seams with a minimum 2 in. (50 mm) overlap. Make all lapped seams in the direction of the paving operation to prevent pickup by the paving train. The width of the fabric strips shall be shown on the plans. Make joint overlaps to prevent pickup by the paving train that places the asphaltic concrete.

D. Protecting Fabric

When full width fabric is used, schedule work so that the fabric will be covered with asphaltic concrete prior to reopening the section to traffic. Do not allow traffic, other than necessary construction equipment or emergency vehicles, on unprotected fabric. If approved by the Engineer, traffic will be allowed to use a section with applied fabric strips for a maximum of 7 days. Coordinate all activities to conform to this restriction. Replace any damaged fabric prior to paving at the Contractor’s expense. When short-term pavement markings are required, the markings shall meet the requirements of Section 150. When in-place fabric is exposed to moisture prior to application of the overlay, make sure the fabric is completely dry before the overlay is placed. If the fabric sticks to tires of trucks or paving equipment during the construction overlays, hot mix asphalt may be broadcast over the fabric for protection.

E. Placing Overlay

Use an asphaltic concrete overlay that meets the requirements of Section 400. Prior to placement of the overlay, apply a bituminous tack coat over the fabric at a rate determined by the Engineer as described in Subsection 400.3.03.A.3. The minimum thickness of asphaltic concrete over the strip shall be 2 in. (50 mm). Milling may be required to provide the minimum thickness. When using a vibratory roller for compaction, avoid the use of excessive amplitude. The use of excessive amplitude during the compaction process may result in an undesirable riding surface.

# C. Grout Pumping Equipment

Use grout pumping equipment with a positive displacement plunger or piston-type pump or a screw-type worm pump.

1. Ensure that the discharge line is equipped with the following:
- Pressure gauge at the pump capable of measuring from 0 to 200 psi (0 to 1380 kPa)
- Positive cut-off valve at the nozzle end
- Bypass return line for recirculating the grout back into a holding tank or mixer
2. Equip the end of the discharge line with a nozzle or device that remains secure in the drilled holes and is free of leaks.
3. Furnish a blow pipe with enough air pressure to dislodge loose debris.
4. Provide an auger of the proper size and length to open clogged holes.

# D. Drilling Equipment

Provide the following drilling equipment:

- Air compressors—Provide air compressors with enough capacity to operate pneumatic hammers or drills.
- Pneumatic or hydraulic drills—Provide pneumatic or hydraulic drills equipped with bits that will cut 1.5 in. (38 mm) or other approved diameter holes through the concrete pavement.

Operate the equipment so as to prevent damage to the pavement being drilled. Do not create excessive down pressure to force the bit through the concrete rapidly. The Engineer must approve the drilling procedure.

# E. Slab Stabilization Testing Equipment

Furnish a two-axle truck with dual rear wheels. Load the rear axle to 18 kips (8000 kg) evenly distributed between the two sides.

# F. Slab Lift Measuring Equipment

Section 450 — Pressure Grouting Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

# 450.3.05 Construction

# A. Observing Weather Limitations

Begin pressure grouting operations when the air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat is at least 35 ºF (2 ºC) and rising. Stop pressure grouting if the temperature is 40 ºF (4 ºC) and falling or when the subgrade contains an abnormal amount of moisture.

# B. Testing

Slab testing is performed to detect all slabs having a deflection greater than 0.030 in. (0.76 mm). Perform testing between 3:00 AM and 9:00 AM, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer. In hot weather, test between 3:00 AM and 7:00 AM if directed by the Engineer. Stop testing if slabs are beginning to “lock-up.”

# 1. Preliminary Testing by the Department

Preliminary testing is not required on slabs that require grouting but have been previously tested and marked by the Department.

# 2. Preliminary Testing by the Contractor

If the Department has not performed preliminary testing, use static methods to test each transverse joint and crack on the Project or within designated Project areas. Do not test, however, transverse cracks in slabs that are to be replaced entirely. Test the joints and cracks as follows:

- Furnish four gauges on two-gauge mounts (two gauges per mount) that can detect slab movement under the load to the nearest 0.001 in. (0.025 mm).
- Maintain the gauges and mounts in operating order. Furnish the loaded truck, truck operator, and personnel to place and assist in operating the gauges.
- Position one set of gauges with one gauge referenced to the corner of each slab on both sides of the joint near the pavement edge. Zero in the gauges with no load on the slab on either side of the joint.
- Move the test truck into position and stop it with the center of the test axle about 1 ft. (300 mm) behind the joint and the outside test wheel approximately 1 ft. (300 mm) from the pavement edge.
- Read the back gauge and move the test truck across the joint to about 1 ft. (300 mm) forward of the joint. Read the forward gauge.
- Repeat this operation for each joint to be tested. The Inspector will read and record the gauges.
- When required, perform additional tests on slabs that move more than 0.030 in. (0.76 mm) or as shown on the plans. Perform additional tests as follows:
1. Drill one hole in the corner of the slab where the movement was measured.
2. Drill the holes the same diameter as the undersealing holes and place the holes 18 in. (450 mm) from the transverse and shoulder joint.
3. Fill the test holes with water and observe.
4. If the Engineer believes the pavement system readily drains the water poured into the test hole, pressure grout the slab. Based on the results of testing, deflection measurements, and water drainage observations, the Engineer will determine which slabs require undersealing.
- After the designated slabs have been pressure grouted according to these Specifications, retest them according to Subsection 450.3.05.B.2, Testing.
- Regrout and retest slabs that deflect more than 0.030 in. (0.76 mm) or deflect the amount shown on the plans, as directed. Slabs will be accepted that continue to show movement greater than specified after two properly performed groutings.

# Section 450 — Pressure Grouting Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

# C. Drilling Holes

The Plans show the location of holes to be drilled in each type of slab for undersealing. However, whenever possible, use the holes from previous undersealing work by redrilling.

To begin drilling:

1. Use the hole pattern and pumping sequence shown on the Plans with modifications to use as many holes from previous undersealing work as possible. The Engineer may alter the hole pattern. Only the actual number of holes drilled will be considered for payment for the initial undersealing.
2. Drill the holes 1.5 in. (38 mm) diameter or another size if approved by the Engineer. Ensure that the holes provide positive seal for the pumping nozzle.
3. For the first undersealing, drill the holes to approximately 8 in. (200 mm) deep beneath the bottom of the concrete unless the Engineer approves an alternate depth. The Engineer shall designate the number, depth, and location of holes for undersealing attempts after the initial attempt.
4. Be careful during operations to not break or crack the slabs.
5. Repair slabs that have cracks that extend through the drill hole at the Contractor’s expense. Make repairs according to Section 609 and Section 452.

# D. Cleaning Holes

After drilling the holes, and immediately before pumping the underseal grout, insert a pipe with enough air pressure in each hole to remove debris and to provide a passage for the grout, if necessary.

# E. Pumping Underseal Grout

Properly position the lift measuring device before pumping grout under a slab. Fill the voids under a slab as follows:

1. Pump grout in holes designated by the Engineer.
2. Have the Engineer determine the time of day to perform pressure grouting. The Engineer may require pressure grouting during late night and early morning hours if the slabs cannot be stabilized with daytime grouting.
3. During pumping, watch the lift measuring device to prevent excessive pumping pressures, rapid lifting of slabs, or substantial rising of the adjacent shoulders.
4. Stop pumping in the hole when the cavities or voids are filled within the range of the hole being grouted. Grout flowing out of an adjacent hole or joint or the edge of the slab is sufficient evidence that the voids and cavities are filled, and pumping should cease. Additional evidence is that the slab rises rapidly, or the adjacent shoulder begins to rise.
1. Lift the slab slightly to move grout into the existing cavities and voids.
2. Do not lift more than 0.050 in. (1.3 mm) for a slab measured at the outside joint corner unless approved by the Engineer.

NOTE: Do not crack the slabs by differential lifting.
5. Secure the discharge hose nozzle in the hole to provide a seal that will maintain the grout pressure underneath the slab. Ensure that the nozzle end does not extend below the bottom of the concrete.
6. Continue pumping in a hole until a clear flow of grout comes out other holes, joints, or cracks, or until the slab begins to lift excessively.
7. Repeat this procedure in other holes until the voids are filled. Do not plug the holes during grouting operations.

---

Section 450 — Pressure Grouting Portland Cement Concrete Pavement

8. When edge drains are near the shoulder or pavement interface, take precautions to minimize the amount of grout that flows into the edge drain system. Use the following procedure or an alternate approved by the Engineer to monitor grout flow into the edge drain system:

- a. Drill one or more “observation holes” in the asphaltic concrete shoulder as close as possible to the shoulder or pavement interface.
- b. Time the grouting operation to prevent and stop excess grouting in a hole to ensure that grout does not flow into the edge drain system.
- c. When grouting operations are complete, fill the “observation holes” with asphaltic concrete.

9. Prevent slabs from cracking during the undersealing operation. Remove and replace slabs cracked during this operation at the Contractor’s expense according to Section 609 and Section 452.

# F. Cleaning Up

Before permitting traffic on the section, remove grout deposits on the pavement or shoulders and clean the surface. Remove debris, bags, spillage, etc., from the Right-of-Way each day.

# G. Permanently Sealing Holes

Remove the grout from the holes and fill the holes with a stiff sand-cement mixture or an approved quick setting patching material. Repair filled holes that ravel out or become damaged. Also, repair unsatisfactorily filled holes from previous undersealing work at the Contractor’s expense, as directed by the Engineer.

# H. Testing for Slab Stability

After pumping the grout under the designated slab and permitting traffic over the slabs for at least 12 hours, test the slabs for stability. Conduct these tests by static loading as in Subsection 450.3.05.B.2.h and Subsection 450.3.05.B.2.i. Based on the test results and criteria on the plans, the slabs will be accepted or designated for further undersealing as directed by the Engineer.

# I. Opening to Traffic

Do not permit traffic on the grouted slabs until the grout has taken an initial set (normally 4 to 6 hours). Schedule the operations so that the grout has initially set, and the work area is cleared before traffic is allowed on the grouted slabs.

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 450.3.07 Contractor Warranty and Maintenance

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 450.4 Measurement

Portland cement incorporated into the pressure grout slurry is measured by the 94 lb. (42.6 kg) bag.

# A. Holes

On an initial undersealing attempt, holes drilled through the existing concrete slabs at the locations and to the depths shown on the Plans or directed by the Engineer are measured per each. If holes drilled for the first stabilizing attempt are used for the second stabilizing attempt, holes are not paid for again by the Department. If new holes are drilled, they are measured per each.

The Engineer will check the compressed air daily for contamination. Do not use contaminated air.

# 451.3.03 Preparation

# A. Removing and Preparing the Repair Area

Prepare to perform partial patching of spalled joints and potholes as follows:

1. Partial Depth Patching of Spalled Joints
1. “Sound” each transverse joint and longitudinal joint with a visual defect to determine the limits of the damaged or defective areas. Strike the pavement surface along the sides of each joint with a hammer, chain drag, or similar tool to detect unsound concrete that sounds flat or hollow.
2. Mark the limits of the defective areas on the pavement by making a rectangle 2 in. (50 mm) beyond the outer limits of the unsound concrete area as a guide for sawing.
3. Mark spalled areas less than 2 ft. (600 mm) from each other along a joint as one spall area. If separated by 2 ft. (600 mm) or more, mark as separate spall areas. Do not repair defective (spalled) joint areas less than 6 in. (150 mm) long and 1.5 in. (40 mm) wide under this specification. Thoroughly clean and seal them with silicone sealant as part of the joint sealing operation specified in Section 461.
4. Saw the rectangular marked areas with near vertical faces at least 2 in (50 mm) but not more than 3 in. (75 mm) deep.
5. Remove unsound material within the sawed area with a maximum 30 lb. (135 N) chipping hammer.
6. Do not damage or fracture the sound concrete substrate to be left on the bottom of the spall area. Do not use sharp pointed bits.
7. If the unsound material is more than 4 in. (100 mm) deep, the Engineer may direct a 6 ft. (1.8 m) slab replacement be placed, which is classified and paid for under Section 609 and Section 452.
8. Before placing the patching material, saw the face of the existing transverse or longitudinal joints bordering the repair areas. Saw at least 5 in. (125 mm) deep and 0.25 in. (6 mm) wide with the full depth of the saw cut extending at least 1 in. (25 mm) beyond the limits of the repair areas in each direction.
9. Immediately before placing the patching material, thoroughly clean the surfaces within the repair areas by sandblasting and air blasting to remove oil, dust, dirt, traces of asphaltic concrete, slurry from saw operation, and other contaminants.
10. Place a 0.25 in. (6 mm) wide piece of closed cell polyethylene foam shaped to fit the saw cut in the joints bordering the repair areas. If “back-to-back” repairs are made at a joint, support the 0.25 in. (6 mm) closed-cell polyethylene foam during the placing operation to maintain a true, straight joint line. Have the Engineer approve the method used. The polyethylene foam must be supported in a straight line when the patching material is placed so a straight joint line will be formed. Maintain a straight line or the Engineer may require the repairs be repeated at no additional cost to the Department.
2. Partial Depth Patching of Pavement Potholes
The Engineer will determine which pavement potholes will be repaired. Use the procedures given for repairing spalled joints to repair potholes within the pavement surface. The requirement of using the 0.25 in (6 mm) closed-cell polyethylene foam does not apply.

Section 451 — Patching Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (Spall Repair)

# 451.3.05 Construction

# A. Concrete Patching

Patch concrete one lane at a time, safely and rapidly to minimize inconvenience to the traveling public.

1. Accomplish the work with other operations in progress within an area if possible.
2. Complete the work before the grinding operation begins, if grinding is specified.
3. Remove and replace completed concrete patches that contain cracks, shrinkage, compression failures, or are damaged by construction or traffic before Final Acceptance at no additional cost to the Department.

# B. Placing Patching Material

Use Repair Method 1 unless the State Materials Research Engineer gives written approval to use Repair Method 2. Use Repair Method 1 when the average daily temperature is 50 ºF (10 ºC) or above. Use of Repair Method 2, if approved, is limited to the manufacturer’s written recommendations.

For the following repair methods, begin the placement when the surface within the repair area is dry and thoroughly free of contaminants. Ensure that the finished surface including joints meets a surface tolerance of 1/8 in. (3 mm) per 10 ft. (3 m). Use approved measures as necessary to keep pavement surfaces adjacent to this operation free of excess grout and other materials. Unless otherwise specified, complete the patching operations and open the lanes to traffic before sunset each day.

1. # Repair Method 1: Twenty-four Hour Accelerated Strength Concrete

Use this method as follows:

1. Completely coat the concrete surface areas within the repair area with a film of Type II epoxy approximately 10 to 20 mils (0.25 to 0.50 mm) thick.
2. Mix the concrete on site in a portable mixer. Obtain approval for the mix design and mixing method from the laboratory. The material must meet a slump range of 1.0 in. (25mm) to 3.0 in. (75mm).
3. Deposit the concrete in the repair area while the epoxy is still tacky. Vibrate it to form a dense, homogeneous mass of concrete that completely fills the patch area.
4. Screed the concrete to the proper grade and do not disturb it until the water sheen disappears from the surface.
5. Cover the concrete with wet burlap or membrane curing compound. Allow the curing to continue for at least three hours. The Engineer may require longer curing to ensure sufficient concrete strength development before opening to traffic.
2. # Repair Method 2: Rapid Setting Patching Material for Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (Type I, II, IV, and V)

Section 452 — Full Depth Slab Replacement

# 452.3.02 Equipment

Use sufficient equipment to perform work such as drilling dowel holes, setting dowels, spreading, striking off, consolidating, screeding concrete, and sawing and sealing joints. Obtain the Engineer’s approval of the equipment before starting the work.

Place the dowels at the locations specified on the Plans by using pneumatic or hydraulic drills and bits that will drill a 1-3/8 in. (35 mm) diameter hole in the existing concrete faces.

# 452.3.03 Preparation

# A. Clean the Exposed Faces

Before placing the concrete, thoroughly clean the vertical exposed faces of the existing slabs to remove contaminates.

1. Use wire brushing or other methods approved by the Engineer.
2. Remove existing silicone or other joint sealant from the exposed concrete faces.

# B. Preparing Base

Remove debris and standing water from the base. Thoroughly compact loose base material by hand tamping before placing concrete.

# 452.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 452.3.05 Construction

# A. Installing the Dowels

Complete these steps to install the dowels:

1. Use a pneumatic or hydraulic drill to drill a 1-3/8 in. (35 mm) diameter hole in the existing concrete faces. Place the dowels at locations specified on the Plans.
2. If the Engineer allows, drill a hole no greater than 1.5 in. (38 mm) diameter to insert the dowel bars. Follow these guidelines:
1. Operate the equipment so as to prevent damage to the pavement being drilled.
2. Obtain the Engineer’s approval for the drilling procedure.
3. Thoroughly clean the drilled holes of contaminants.
3. Set the type and size of dowels specified in the Plans into the hardened concrete face of the existing pavement with Type VIII epoxy bonding compound that meets the requirements in Section 886.
1. Place the dowels at locations noted on the Plans with one-half of the dowel protruding out of the pavement.
2. Place the dowels at the correct horizontal and vertical alignment. Do not misalign them more than 3/8 in. (10 mm) within the vertical or oblique plane.
3. Place enough epoxy in the back of the hole to completely fill the entire cavity around the dowel upon insertion of the dowel bar. Remove excess epoxy.
4. Use epoxy adhesive packaged in a cartridge with a mixing nozzle that thoroughly mixes the two components as they are dispensed. Use a mixing nozzle at least 8 in. (200 mm) long. Or, use a machine that mixes the two components thoroughly to the proper ratio as the material is being placed.
5. Allow the epoxy to harden before placing the concrete to prevent the dowels from moving during the concrete placement.



---

Section 452 — Full Depth Slab Replacement

4. At the free joints shown on the Plans, use epoxy-coated, plain, round, steel dowel bars that meet the requirements of Subsection 853.2.08. Coat the protruding portion of the epoxy coated dowels with a thin film of grease or other approved material to ensure proper bond-breaking characteristics.

5. Cleanly saw the edges of the epoxy-coated smooth dowels bars. Do not shear them.

NOTE 1: Never drive dowels into a dowel hole with a sledge hammer or other device.

NOTE 2: Coated dowels will be rejected if they cannot be freely inserted into a dowel hole.

# B. Setting Forms

Forms are not required for this work. The vertical faces of the existing pavement and shoulder bordering the replaced slab or joint area serve as the forms. However, if the shoulder is irregular or unstable:

1. Place a form the full depth of the replaced slab or joint area to maintain a true, straight shoulder joint and to prevent the concrete from intruding into the shoulder area.
2. Compact the foundation under the form true to grade so that the form, when set, will firmly contact the base at the correct grade.
3. Clean and oil the forms before placing the concrete.
4. Wait four hours to remove the forms from the freshly placed concrete, unless otherwise specified. Carefully remove the forms to avoid damaging the pavement.
5. Repair the shoulder to the Engineer’s satisfaction at no additional cost to the Department.

# C. Placing and Finishing Concrete

The required concrete for the work will be 24-hour accelerated strength concrete that meets the requirements of Section 504. Obtain mix design approval from the Laboratory before use. Place the concrete only when the ambient temperature is 40 °F (4 °C) and rising. Do not place concrete when the underlying base material is muddy or frozen.

1. Deposit the concrete within the slab replacement area in a way that requires as little re-handling as possible and prevents mix segregation.
2. Minimize hand spreading as much as possible. But where necessary, use shovels not rakes.

NOTE: Do not allow workmen to walk in fresh concrete with shoes coated with earth or other foreign substances.

Fill the replaced slab area with concrete and thoroughly consolidate by rodding, spading, and using sufficient vibration to form a dense homogeneous mass throughout the area.

# Section 452 — Full Depth Slab Replacement

4. Ensure the final surface area has a uniform appearance and is free of irregularities and porous areas. The finished surface, including joints, shall meet a surface tolerance of 1/8 in. in 10 ft. (3 mm in 3 m) in any direction. For slab replacements done in preparation for resurfacing of the pavement, the finished surface, including joints, shall meet a surface tolerance of 3/16 in. in 10 ft. (5 mm in 3 m) in any direction.

Perform necessary corrections by grinding according to Section 431. The Engineer may order replacement if any replaced slab is low in relation to adjacent slabs. The Engineer will require replacement if it is determined that excessive pavement grinding is necessary to match the profile of the full depth slab replacement or if grinding the adjacent pavement would create a drainage problem.

Do the following at no additional cost to the Department:

- Perform all necessary corrections
- Furnish all necessary traffic control personnel, materials, and equipment to detect deviations.
- Grind or replace slabs to correct surface tolerance deviations

If the Project involves resurfacing or grinding the pavement surface, a flat finish will be satisfactory. Otherwise, a broom or hand-tine finish will be required that will produce a surface texture depth of 0.20 in. (5mm) or greater as measured by GDT 72. The Engineer shall approve the finishing method and any deficient areas corrected to his or her satisfaction and performed at your expense.

# D. Curing Concrete

Use the applicable portions of Section 504 regarding concrete mix and curing in this work.

# E. Sawing and Sealing Joints

Establish transverse and longitudinal joints within the slab replacement area by doing the following:

1. Saw and seal the joints with silicone sealant that meets the requirements of Subsection 833.2.06. Seal according to Plan details and Section 461.
2. Ensure that the width of the sawed joints is 3/8 in. (10 mm), unless otherwise directed.
3. Saw and seal the joints as soon as possible, but not more than 60 days after placing the slab, unless the Plans specify otherwise. Sawing and sealing of the reestablished joints is included in the bid cost for slab replacement.

# F. Protecting from Rain

Properly protect the concrete from rain before the concrete hardens by following these guidelines:

1. Keep the materials to protect the concrete surface available at all times. Protective materials include burlap or cotton mats, curing paper, or plastic sheeting material.
2. When rain is imminent, stop the paving operations and begin covering the surface of the unhardened concrete with the protective covering.

# G. Working at Night

If night work is authorized on the Project, provide lighting for work performed at night for safety, traffic control, and work control and completion. Correct unsatisfactory work to the Engineer’s satisfaction at no additional cost to the Department.

# H. Opening to Traffic

Schedule slab replacements so that the concrete will have a curing time of at least four hours. Complete the work and open the lanes to traffic before sunset the day it is placed, unless authorized otherwise. The Engineer may require a longer curing period, mix design adjustments, or other corrective action to ensure sufficient concrete strength development before opening to traffic.

Section 461 — Sealing Roadway and Bridge Joints and Cracks

# 461.3.02 Equipment

# A. Air Compressors

Use air compressors equipped with traps to remove surplus water and oil in the compressed air. Do not use contaminated air. Ensure that the compressor can deliver compressed air at a continuous pressure of at least 90 psi (600 kPa). The Engineer may check the compressed air for contamination.

# B. Silicone Sealant Pump

Apply silicone sealant by pumping only. Use a caulking gun with a cartridge for touch-up work or small applications only. Use a pump with sufficient capacity to deliver the necessary volume of silicone to completely fill the joint in a single pass. Ensure that the nozzle’s size and shape closely fits into the joint to fill the joint with sealant with enough force to prevent voids in the sealant and to force the sealant to contact the joint faces.

# C. Caulking Gun

Use a caulking gun with cartridge for the following situations:

- Touch up work.
- Placing vertical runs of Type A silicone in a bridge deck joint when Type B, C, or D silicone is used in the horizontal runs.
- Sealing voids and cracks with Type A silicone where Type B, C, or D silicone (which will be applied on top of the Type A silicone) might leak through.
- Sealing small cracks in the concrete.

# 461.3.03 Preparation

Before installing a bond breaker or sealant, ensure that the joint is clean and dry. Complete all cleaning, air blasting, or air drying.

# 461.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 461.3.05 Construction

# A. Resealing Existing Joints

1. Remove Existing Sealant
Completely remove the existing sealant in the joints. Take care during removal and cleaning to prevent damaging or enlarging the existing width of the joint. Repair any damaged areas at no cost to the Department.
2. Depth of Existing Joint
Determine if the joint depth will accommodate the required sealant thickness and bond breaker and provide the required recess below the riding surface. Consider that the backer rod is thicker after it is squeezed into the joint. If necessary, saw the existing joint deeper and wider to provide the joint depth and width specified on the plans.
3. Clean the Joint
Thoroughly clean the joint of all foreign material including oil, asphalt, curing compound, sealant adhesive, paint, rust, and existing sealant, if still present. Demonstrate to the Engineer that the proposed method of cleaning old sealant or foreign material from joints will not widen the joints by more than 0.040 in. (1 mm). The method shall not alter the joint profile (including rounding of the top corner) or alter the texture of the concrete riding surface. Do not use chemical agents to clean the joint. Ensure that the cleaning process produces a new, clean concrete face on the vertical faces of the joint.

Section 461 — Sealing Roadway and Bridge Joints and Cracks

# B. Sealing New Joints

# 1. Sawing

Saw the transverse and longitudinal joints according to the specifications and plan details.

1. Make the initial cut and wait for the concrete to harden enough to prevent spalling or raveling:
2. Make the second cut to the width and depth shown on the plans.

NOTE: Do not use a gang saw to make a completed cut in a single operation.

If spalling of the sawed edge harms the joint seal, patch the spall with an approved epoxy patching compound and allow it to fully cure before installing the joint sealant.
Make each patch to the intended neat lines of the finished cut joint.

# 2. Cleaning Freshly Cut Sawed Joints

Immediately after sawing the joint do the following:

1. Completely remove the resulting slurry from the joint and clean the immediate area by flushing it with a jet of water under pressure. Use other tools as necessary.
2. When the surfaces are thoroughly clean and dry and immediately before placing the joint sealer, use compressed air with a pressure of at least 90 psi (620 kPa) to blow out the joint and remove dust traces.
3. If freshly cut sawed joints are contaminated before they are sealed, clean them according to Section 461.
4. Ensure that cleaning methods do not alter the joint profile, the rounding of the top corners, or the concrete riding surface texture. Do not clean the joint with chemical agents.

# C. Sealing Joints

# 1. Install Bond Breakers

Select and use bond breakers [backer rod (if required) or tape] according to Section 833.2.06.A.2.

1. Before installing a bond breaker, clean and dry the joint or crack. Before placing the bond breaker and sealant, complete the cleaning, air blasting, or air drying.
2. Ensure that the backer rod diameter is at least 25 percent larger than the joint width.
3. Install the backer rod in the joint at the depth specified on the joint detail in the plans, as directed by the Engineer, and according to Subsection 461.3.05.B.

NOTE: The width of some bridge joints may require back-up material other than the typically shaped round backer rod.

Use material available in square or rectangular shapes or cut the strips from sheet stock to fit properly into the joint. Use approved bond breaking tapes in place of backer rod in some applications. See plan details for various joint types.

# 2. Install Silicone Sealant

Install the silicone sealant immediately after cleaning the joint or crack and installing the bond breaker. Keep the joint or crack clean and dry.

If the joint or crack becomes contaminated, damp, or wet, remove the bond breaker if it has been installed. Clean and dry the joint or crack and install a new bond breaker before placing the sealant.

Follow these guidelines when placing the sealant:

1. Ensure that the air temperature during placement is at least 40 ºF (4 ºC).
2. Use a pump to apply the silicone sealant. The pump must be able to completely fill the joint to the specified width and height of sealant in one pass. Use a nozzle with the proper size and shape to closely fit inside the joint. The sealant must be introduced inside the joint with enough pressure to prevent voids in the sealant and to force the sealant into contact with the joint faces.

# Section 461 — Sealing Roadway and Bridge Joints and Cracks

1. Use a caulking gun with cartridge for touch-up work, small applications (such as vertical runs with Type A silicone in a bridge deck joint when Type B, C, or D silicone is used), and to seal voids and cracks with Type A silicone where Type B, C, or D silicone might leak through. You may also use a caulking gun to seal small cracks in the concrete.
2. After placing Type A silicone sealant, tool it to provide the specified recess, thickness, and shape as shown on the Plans. Apply sufficient force to the sealant in this tooling operation to force the sealant against the joint faces and to ensure proper wetting and bonding of the sealant to the joint faces. Type B, C, and D silicones are self-leveling and do not normally require tooling.
3. Because of the consistency of Type B, C, and D silicones, ensure that the bond breaker completely closes off gaps and voids where the silicone might leak through. To ensure that the gaps are closed use any of the following methods:

- Stuff small pieces of backer-rod into the gaps and voids
- Place a piece of bond breaking tape over the void
- Use Type A silicone to seal the void.

If using Type B, C, or D silicone and a backer-rod, ensure the backer rod is Type M. Do not use Type L backer-rod with Type B, C, and D silicone.
4. Place the sealant to conform to the specified recess and thickness shown in the plans.

# 3. Clean Pavement

After sealing a joint or crack, immediately remove the surplus sealant or other residue on the pavement or structure surfaces.

# 4. Open to Traffic

Do not permit traffic on the sealed joints or cracks until:

- The sealant is tack free.
- The sealant has cured enough to resist displacement from slab movement or other causes.
- Debris from traffic does not imbed into the sealant.

# 5. Special Requirements

The following requirements apply to this work:

1. Seal the joints and cracks for any one day’s work on resealing projects within 30 calendar days after surface grinding for that day is completed, unless otherwise specified on the Plans. Seal joints on new pavement after the curing period. When the Plans call for resealing before specified grinding, increase the recess depth and joint depth by 1/4 to 3/8 in. (6 to 10 mm) to compensate for the depth of the pavement removed during the grinding operation.
2. The Engineer will determine all cracks to be resealed.
3. Route cracks to the depth specified on the Plans by wet or dry sawing with diamond or abrasive blades. Remove sawing residue or other contaminants.
4. If the manufacturer recommends a primer, use it according to the recommendations. When required, install primer before the backup material.
5. Seal the bridge joints, including the approach slab, specified on the plans. Only reseal non-armored joints (one-sealant receptacle and concrete surfaces on joint faces), unless otherwise indicated on the plans.

# 500.3.05 Construction

# A. Meet General Responsibilities

General construction responsibilities include:

1. Batch, mix, deliver, and place concrete according to the Specifications.
2. Have enough production and placement capacity to continuously mix, place, and finish the concrete in each pour unit during daylight hours. If necessary, place concrete at night when adequate lighting facilities exist, and the Engineer approves of the operations and facilities.
3. If a pour cannot be completed, do the following:
1. Form an approved construction joint.
2. Remove the partial pour.
3. Take other remedial measures directed by the Engineer at no additional expense to the Department.
4. Schedule placement to minimize exposure of freshly poured concrete to potentially harmful drying elements such as wind and sun before curing materials are applied and protect freshly poured concrete from exposure to excess moisture and freezing for a minimum of 24 hours when such weather conditions exist.

# B. Construct Falsework

Accept responsibility for the design, construction, protection, and performance of falsework. Repair or remove and replace (as the Engineer directs) concrete, other material, or portions of the structure that are damaged or destroyed due to falsework failure.

Construct falsework for prestressed post-tensioned concrete structures according to the Contract Special Provisions.

Construct falsework for structures other than post-tensioned box girders as follows:

1. Meet Design Criteria
Ensure that falsework structural components that have similar functions in an individual permanent span have the same geometric properties and are made of the same materials. When designing and centering formwork, treat concrete as a liquid, and use the following weights:

- 150 lbs./ft.³ (23.6 kN/m³) for vertical loading
- 85 lbs./ft.³ (13.4 kN/m³) for horizontal loading
- 75 lbs./ft.² (3.6 kN/m²) live load for deck placement operations

Use the following falsework design criteria:

- Design and construct falsework logically so the Bridge Design Office can analyze it using a commonly accepted structural design theory.
- Avoid exceeding safe working values for material stresses.
- Provide support for the imposed loads, without settling or deforming and a way to compensate for settlement, if it occurs.
2. Support Falsework
Support falsework using one of these methods:

- Support on piling driven and removed as directed
- Found on a footing approved by the Engineer
3. Construct Falsework
Construct and set falsework to provide the finished structure the specified camber and finished grade. Place “telltales” at locations directed by the Engineer to observe how much the falsework settles.

- Meet the design criteria for falsework in Subsection 500.3.05.B.1, Meet Design Criteria.
- Account for the use of retarded concrete.

Ensure that bracing, ties, and supports are placed accurately. If the formwork appears to be inadequately supported, tied, or braced (before or during concrete placement), the Engineer may require that the Work stop until the defects are corrected.

# D. Use Acceptable Form Materials

Except as noted, fabricate forms from the following materials:

- Lumber
- Plywood
- Metal
- Plastic
- Combinations of these

Use material free of defects that materially affect form strength or materially impair the accuracy or appearance of the concrete surface.

Use the form materials as follows:

# 1. Lumber Forms

Construct wood forms as follows:

- Size and dress the lumber.
- Use lumber at least 1 in. (25 mm) thick.
- Use lumber for header forms used as screed supports and for curb face forms at least 2 in. (50 mm) thick.
- Avoid using scrap material or doing patchwork.
- Stagger all joints but those between abutting panels.
- Line the lumber used to form outside vertical surfaces of exterior beams or girders with an approved form liner.
- Use chamfer strips mill-produced from high-quality lumber, free of defects.
- Dress and finish chamfer strips on all three sides.
- Size chamfer strips to the proper dimensions.

# 2. Plywood Forms

Construct plywood forms as follows:

- If plywood is the type made for general concrete forms and is at least 5/8 in. (16 mm) thick, use it in place of 1 in. (25 mm) thick lumber to construct forms, if necessary.
- Ensure that plywood used to form open joints and to line forms is at least 1/4 in. (6 mm) thick.
- When nailing plywood directly to form studs, do not space the studs more than 16 in. (400 mm) apart.
- Use plywood in full sheets wherever practical. Do not do patchwork with small, irregular pieces.
- Have the Engineer inspect and approve plywood sheet layout.

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# 3. Metal or Plastic Forms

1. Construct metal or plastic forms as follows:
2. Use metal or plastic to form concrete only if the Engineer approves the forms and if the forms produce satisfactory results.
3. Use metal forms that produce finished concrete equal to or superior to concrete made from comparable wooden forms.
4. Countersink bolts and rivets in the surfaces of metal forms that touch concrete.
5. Grind welds smooth in the surfaces of metal forms to provide a smooth plane surface.

# 4. Other Material Uses

Use tempered fiberboard for form liners when necessary if it is at least 1/4 in. (6 mm) thick. Use tempered fiberboard 1/8 in. (3 mm) thick only to form open joints. Support the fiberboard with suitable spacers arranged properly. Use approved synthetic materials for forming open joints and for other special uses, if necessary.

# E. Construct Form Supports

Construct form supports using metal ties, anchors, and hangers as follows:

1. Construct supports that will remain in the finished concrete so they can be removed from the concrete face to a depth of at least 1 in. (25 mm) without damaging the concrete.
2. Weld form supports to girder or beam flanges in continuous or cantilever spans only in the flange areas which are in compression.
3. When ordinary wire ties or snap ties are permitted, cut them back at least 3/8 in. (10 mm) from the face of the concrete.
4. Design metal tie fittings that minimize the cavities made when they are removed. Fill all cavities after removing metal tie fittings.

# F. Construct Temporary Forms

Construct temporary forms as follows:

1. Construct and maintain forms in a mortar-tight condition.
2. Construct forms so that they can be removed easily without damaging the concrete, unless using forms that will remain in place.
3. Build, line, and brace forms so that the formed concrete surface conforms with the dimensions, lines, and grades shown on the plans.
4. Build headwall forms for skewed pipe parallel to the roadway centerline or at right angles to the radius on curves. Construct headwall forms as follows:
1. Lay enough pipe to extend through the headwall form.
2. After the concrete is poured and hardened, carefully cut and dress the protruding pipe ends so no ragged edges remain.

The Contractor may choose, as an alternate to the above method, to build a circular form that exactly fits the pipe circumference and face of the headwall form.
5. Construct form liner using plywood or other approved form liner as follows:
1. Use form liner in large sheets. Do not do patchwork.
2. Avoid irregular joint location in form liners.
3. Have the Engineer inspect and approve the proposed liner layout.
6. Bevel forms at beam copings, girders, and other projections to ease removal.
7. Place chamfer strips to chamfer exposed edges of the concrete by the required amount. Use ¾ in. (19 mm) chamfers unless otherwise shown on the plans.
8. Patch with tin or other metal only in those areas of the superstructure lying between and including the inside faces of the exterior beams.

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

9. When shown on the plans, splice water stops to form continuous water-tight joints. Hold stops in position while placing concrete.

10. Immediately before erecting forms or just before placing bar reinforcement steel, coat forms with a clear oil or other bond breaker to keep concrete from sticking to the forms.

- a. Do not allow the substance to stain or soften the concrete surface.
- b. Do not apply by reaching or pouring through previously placed reinforcement steel.

11. Wait to place concrete in any form until the Department inspects and approves the form. Inspection and approval does not diminish the responsibility to produce concrete surfaces free of warping, bulging, or other defects.

12. When removing forms, remove chamfer strips, blocks, and bracing.

13. Do not leave any part of a wooden form in the concrete.

14. If concrete surfaces do not meet finish specifications, correct the problems with the following steps, as directed by the Engineer:

- • Repair the defects using approved methods.
- • Remove and replace the affected portion of the work.

# G. Reuse Forms

Reuse forms and form material in good condition and satisfactory as determined by the Engineer. Do not use forms or form materials that are warped, cracked, split, bulging, have separated plies, or have unsatisfactory form liner. Ensure that used forms are mortar tight and produce a finished concrete equivalent to that produced by new forms.

# H. Construct Permanent Steel Bridge Deck Forms for Concrete Deck Slabs

Unless otherwise designated on the Plans, construct and use permanent steel bridge deck forms for concrete bridge deck slabs according to these Specifications. Do not use permanent steel bridge deck forms in panels where longitudinal deck construction joints are located between stringers. Provide a structurally satisfactory slab when using permanent steel bridge deck forms.

1. Fabricate permanent steel bridge deck forms and supports from steel that conforms to ASTM A 653/653M Designation SS, Grade 80/550, Coating Designation G-165/Z-500 and ASTM A 924/924M.
2. Design permanent steel bridge deck forms as follows:
- a. Account for the dead load of the following:
- • Form
- • Reinforcement steel
- • Plastic concrete
- b. Add 50 lbs./ft² (2.4 kN/m²) for construction loads.
- c. Ensure that the unit working stress in the steel sheet does not exceed 0.725 of the specified minimum yield strength for the material furnished. However, do not allow the unit working stress to exceed 36,000 psi (250 MPa).
- d. Account for deflection under the weight of the forms, the plastic concrete, and the reinforcement as follows:
1. 1) If deflection exceeds 1/180 of the design span or 1/2 in. (13 mm), whichever is less, use intermediate supports.
2. 2) Do not base deflection on a total load of less than 120 lbs./ft² (5.7 kN/m²).
- e. Base the permissible form camber on the actual dead load condition.
- f. Do not use camber to compensate for deflection that exceeds the above limits.
- g. Compute the form sheets design span using the clear span of the form, plus 2 in. (50 mm), measured parallel to the form flutes.



---

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

h. Compute physical design properties according to the requirements of the latest published edition of the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members.

i. Ensure that all bottom reinforcement has a minimum concrete cover of 1 in. (25 mm) as shown in Figure 1. (Figure 1 metric).

# FIGURE 1

j. Maintain the Plan dimensions of both layers of primary deck reinforcement from the top surface of the concrete deck.

k. Do not use precast mortar blocks to support the deck reinforcement.

l. Do not treat permanent steel bridge deck forms as lateral bracing for the compression flanges of supporting structural members.

3. Do not weld to flanges in tension or to structural steel bridge elements fabricated from non-weldable steel grades. Have welders certified by the Department weld metal deck forms or supports for metal deck forms.

# I. Install Forms

Install and maintain forms in a mortar-tight condition and according to approved fabrication and erection Plans. Place transverse construction joints at the bottom of a flute. Field drill 1/4 in. (6mm) weep holes no less than 12 in. (300 mm) on center along the line of the joint.

# 1. Highway Bridge Forms

Install highway bridge forms with a 1 in. (25 mm) minimum clearance between the top of the form and the bottom of the main deck reinforcement. See Figure 1.

# 2. Railroad Bridge Forms

Install railroad bridge forms as follows:

- a. Place the forms so the tops of the form ribs adjacent to the beam flange are at the bottom of the deck slab specified by the plans.
- b. Maintain the full slab depth detailed on the plans.
- c. Do not allow form ribs to project above the plan bottom of the deck slab.
- d. Do not place form sheets directly on top of the stringer or floor beam flanges.
- e. Securely fasten form sheets to form supports using self-drilling screw fasteners, not by welding. If the Engineer approves, use fastener pins driven into place by a power tool.
- f. Ensure that form sheets have a minimum bearing length of 1 in. (25 mm) at each end.
- g. Do not leave loose sheets or accessories on the deck at the end of a day’s work.
- h. Place form supports so that they contact the flange of the stringer or floor beam.
- i. Attach form supports using welds, bolts, clips, or other approved means.
- j. Do not weld form supports to the flanges of non-weldable steel or to portions of the flange subject to tensile stresses.
- k. Ensure that welding and welds comply with AWS D 1.5 for fillet welds. However, 1/8 in. (3 mm) fillet welds are permitted.

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

J. Repair Damaged Forms

Repair permanently exposed form metal to the Engineer’s satisfaction if the galvanized coating is damaged.

1. Clean the damaged area.
2. Go over the damaged area with a wire brush.
3. Paint the area with two coats of zinc oxide-zinc dust primer that meet Federal Specification TT-P-641d, Type II and has no color added.
4. Do not touch up minor heat discoloration in weld areas.

K. Construct Runways

Provide runways into a deck pour area for moving buggies. If the Engineer approves, use runways to bridge a previous pour that has not reached the minimum strength or age requirements in Subsection 500.3.05.AF.4, Live Loads—Pouring Equipment.

Construct and support runways to protect the forms and the reinforcement steel position.

L. Construct Work Bridges

Provide a work bridge on deck pours. Support the bridge outside the area of the pour receiving a surface finish. If two or more spans will be poured on the same day, the Engineer may require two work bridges.

Design and construct work bridges to meet the following:

- Do not allow the bridge to sag into the fresh concrete.
- Construct the bridge so that transverse finish and curing material can be applied easily regardless of the screed type.

M. Add Water to Concrete

Add water to the concrete at the concrete plant. Do not add indiscriminate amounts of water at the job site. If placement conditions require concrete of a more workable consistency, add small amounts of water at the job site if approved by the Engineer.

Add water at the job site as follows:

1. Determine the quantity of water required to provide the necessary consistency. The Engineer will not approve additions of water that cause the total amount of water to exceed the maximum water/cement ratio established in the Table 1—Concrete Mix Table. The Engineer will reject concrete with water added to it that produces a higher slump than specified in the Table 1—Concrete Mix Table.
2. Do not add water to concrete that has begun to set because of excessive mixing or to concrete that has exceeded mixing or haul time limitations.
3. When adding the water, carefully control the conditions.
4. Position the delivery so the measuring operation is not affected.
5. Measure the water carefully.
6. Inject the water into the mixer forcefully to facilitate uniform mixing.
7. Add water before discharging an appreciable amount of concrete.
8. Do not add more water after concrete discharge begins.
9. After adding the water, mix the concrete an additional 30 revolutions.
10. Finish mixing the concrete before the total revolutions at mixing speed exceed 150.

N. Volumetrically Proportion Concrete

Concrete ingredients may be proportioned volumetrically when non-air entrained concrete is used in miscellaneous concrete, non-exposed footings, culverts smaller than bridge culvert size, or when approved by the Engineer.

# Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# O. Prepare for Concrete Placement

Prepare for concrete placement as follows:

1. Ensure that an adequate supply of concrete will be furnished and placed to meet the requirements specified in Subsection 500.3.05.P, Table 5—Minimum Placement Rates for Bridges, Culverts and Retaining Walls.
2. To ensure a full bond between prestressed concrete deck panels and the cast-in-place concrete, clean the panel before placing the slab concrete.
3. Immediately before placing cast-in-place slab concrete, saturate the prestressed concrete deck panels with water.
4. Immediately before placing concrete in the forms, the concrete will be measured for acceptance tolerances. Acceptance tolerances for each class of concrete are listed in the Table 1—Concrete Mix Table. Conduct the applicable tests according to the procedures in the Sampling, Testing, and Inspection information.

# P. Meet the Minimum Placement Rates

If concrete is not produced, placed, and finished according to the minimum placement rates, the Engineer may reject the pour. Concrete pours of a similar nature and size will not be allowed until the problem is corrected and the placement rate met.

The minimum placement rates are listed in Table 5:

| Bridge Substructure        | Pour Size in Cubic Yards (Meters)                                  | Minimum Placement Rate in Cubic Yards (Meters) per Hour |

# Q. Place Concrete

Place concrete as follows:

1. Do not allow aluminum to touch the concrete while mixing, transporting, handling, or placing it.
2. Transport, handle, and place concrete quickly so that it reaches its final position in the forms within the haul time limitations in Subsection 500.2.01.E.1, Haul Time Limitations.
3. Manipulate the delivery or conveyance unit to avoid vibration damaging to partially set concrete.
4. Immediately before placing the concrete, thoroughly clean and wet the forms.
5. Place concrete as close as possible to its final position in the forms.
6. Use chutes, troughs, or tubes to pour the concrete in the forms, without displacing reinforcement steel.
7. Modify or stop using the equipment if chutes, troughs, or tubes cause honeycombed or otherwise inferior concrete.
8. When placing concrete by pumping, operate the pumping equipment so that the concrete is produced in a continuous stream without air pockets.
9. When concrete placement requires dropping the concrete more than 5 ft (1.5 m), use pipes or tubes to place the concrete. Do not allow concrete to free-fall more than 5 ft. (1.5 m) from the pipe or tube.
10. Place concrete in horizontal layers no more than 18 in. (0.5 m) thick.
11. Place and compact succeeding batches in each layer before the preceding batch takes its initial set.
12. Place each succeeding layer before the underlying layer sets.
13. Consolidate the concrete to avoid cold joints between layers.
14. If the forms sag or bulge while concrete is being placed, remove the concrete causing the distortion and the concrete in adjoining areas if the Engineer requires. Removal prevents cold joints and displaced or damaged reinforcement.
15. Work the concrete around reinforcement bars without displacing them.
16. Compact concrete using suitable tools and vibration.

NOTE: Convey and place concrete by pumping only when specified in the Contract or when authorized by the Engineer.

---

# Section 500 — Concrete Structures

17. Vibrate concrete where it is deposited and vibrate other concrete while it is fresh. Vibrate as follows:

- a. Insert and withdraw vibrators slowly.
- b. Manipulate vibrators to work the concrete around reinforcement and embedded fixtures and into corners of forms.
- c. Vibrate sufficiently to compact the concrete but avoid causing the concrete to segregate.
- d. Stop vibrating before local areas of grout are formed.
- e. Apply vibrators no farther apart than twice the radius through which the vibration is visibly effective.
- f. Do not use vibrators or any other means that could cause segregation to move masses of concrete in the forms.
- g. Do not apply vibrators to sections of concrete that are no longer plastic.
- h. Vibrate concrete-filled steel grid floors by applying the vibrators to the steel.
- i. Vibrate concrete for precast or prestressed units as specified above in steps a through g, unless the Engineer approves alternate methods.
- j. Stop vibration when a mortar line appears on the face of the form and when the coarse aggregate particles are submerged in the concrete mortar.

18. Supplement vibration with spading to ensure smooth surfaces and dense concrete along form faces and in locations difficult to reach with vibrators.

19. After concrete sets initially, do not disturb the forms or the projecting reinforcing bars.

# R. Create Construction Joints

Place construction joints according to the Plans or as directed by the Engineer. If an emergency affects continuous placement, the Engineer will decide if a construction joint is allowed. If allowed, the Engineer will provide instructions about where and how to make the joint. The Engineer may eliminate certain construction joints if placement, finishing and forming methods can produce satisfactory results.

Create construction joints as follows:

1. Remove mortar splashed on form surfaces and projecting reinforcement steel before concrete reaches its initial set.
- a. Do not puddle dried mortar chips and dust into the plastic concrete.
- b. If excess mortar is not removed from reinforcement steel before the concrete reaches its initial set, delay cleaning until the concrete is thoroughly hardened.
2. If joining fresh concrete and hardened concrete, clean the hardened surface of laitance and incompletely bonded, loose, or foreign material. Ensure that laitance is completely removed from the following:
- • Joints between decks and curbs
- • Tops of seal courses
- • Construction joints in concrete exposed to sea water
3. Ensure that the surface of the concrete is dry before pouring the concrete against it.
4. Immediately before placing fresh concrete, tighten the forms against the existing concrete.
5. Use tremies or pumps to coat areas where fresh concrete will be poured with mortar or cement grout.
6. Begin placing concrete immediately after placing the mortar or grout.
7. Apply enough vibration to blend the material with the concrete at the construction joint.

# S. Protect Fresh Concrete

Do not drive pile, blast, or perform other operations that vibrate the formwork or the concrete noticeably before the concrete reaches a strength of 2,000 psi (15 MPa) and is 3 days old. Protect fresh concrete from rainfall with waterproof material such as tarpaulins or plastic film. Ensure that the waterproof material is ready before pouring and is sufficient to cover the area of the pour.

---

# Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# T. Place Bridge Deck Concrete

Do not use calcium chloride or any other admixture containing chloride salts in concrete placed on permanent steel bridge deck forms.

Ensure that the tolerances are accurate for bar reinforcement placement in cast-in-place concrete so the top clearance to the bar reinforcement complies with Subsection 511.3.05.G.6, Bridge Deck Slab Tolerances.

Place bridge deck concrete according to the Contract Specifications and as follows:

1. Before pouring decks, set substantial bulkheads or headers and shape them to the required deck surface cross-section.
2. Ensure that pouring sequences, procedures, and mixes comply with the plans and specifications.
3. Pour the deck according to the numbered sequence as follows:
1. Unless otherwise shown on the Plans, pour each deck in one continuous operation.
2. When dividing deck pours within any one complete unit (a simple span or a continuous or cantilever unit), pour and finish the concrete in the numbered sequence shown on the plans, beginning with the lowest number.
3. Make pours with the same number before pours with higher numbers. Make pours with the same number in any sequence.
4. The numbered sequence shown on the plans also applies to sidewalk pours, but it need not apply to curb, parapet, and handrail pours.
5. Pour diaphragms between steel or prestressed concrete roadway beams at least 24 hours before pouring the deck slab.
6. Unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer, pour all diaphragms within a complete unit before pouring decks.
7. When constructing concrete T-Beams, place girder stems in uniform layers before placing slabs.
8. If T-Beam spans are supported without intermediate false bents, begin deck placement as soon as the first four stems are placed. After the first four stems, avoid getting more than three stems ahead of the advancing line of the deck pour and lagging by more than the space between stems.
9. If T-Beam spans are supported by intermediate false bents, place decks and stems the same as for T-Beam spans supported without intermediate false bents. However, ensure that the slab is placed before a cold joint develops between the stem and slab.
4. Do not make the deck pour until any previously poured concrete in the complete unit has set for 24 hours. This requirement may be waived under certain conditions if the succeeding pour can be completed (except for final finishing) within four hours of the initial placement of the day. The Engineer must give written approval for this requirement to be waived. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, do not place handrail, sidewalks, parapets, and curbs in a complete unit until all the deck slabs in the unit have been poured.
5. Ensure that the pour is the same as the overlap direction (as shown in the shop drawings).
6. Use the following deck pour method:
1. If there is super-elevation, begin deck pours on either the high or the low side.
2. Dump each batch against previously placed concrete.
3. Pour at a rate that ensures fresh concrete along the advancing line of the pour.
4. Vibrate or tamp concrete dumped on fresh concrete to make the grout flow as follows:
- Forward with or slightly ahead of the concrete
- Along the bottoms and sides of the forms
- Around the reinforcement steel

---


# Section 500 — Concrete Structures

1. Once the concrete is poured, vibrate it enough to avoid honeycomb and voids, especially at the following locations:
- Construction joints
- Expansion joints
- Valleys and ends of form sheets
2. Screed the concrete as follows:
1. Use finishing devices operating parallel to the center line. As pouring proceeds, keep the concrete surface screeded to the required grade.
2. Fill depressions ahead of the screed, and keep a small roll of grout on the leading edge of the screed. Perform further screeding with minimum disturbance to the surface already brought to the grade.
3. Take care during the placement and screeding to obtain sound concrete at the construction joint located where the slab joins the curb, parapet, or sidewalk.
4. Do not place excess grout on the leading edge of the screed and do not allow it to remain in this area.
5. Use either a longitudinal screed or a transverse screed.
- Longitudinal Screed
- Before doing the final screeding, place enough concrete in front of the screeding position to deflect the dead load.
- Transverse Screed
- On beam or girder-supported spans with skew angles of 65° or less, place and operate the truss or beam supporting the strike-off parallel to the skew and make the advancing pour line parallel to the skew.
- On beam or girder-supported spans with skew angles between 65° and 90°, position the screed either on the skew or at right angles to the bridge center line.
- On superstructures supported by non-deflecting falsework and on beam- or girder-supported spans with a total dead load deflection no more than 1/2 in. (13 mm), position the screed at right angles to the bridge center line and make the advancing line of pour at right angles to the bridge center line.
6. As the pouring proceeds, keep the concrete surface screeded to the required grade.
7. Fill depressions ahead of the screed. Keep a small roll of grout on the leading edge of the screed.
8. Continue to screed without disturbing the surface already brought to the required grade.
9. Avoid producing unsound concrete where the slab joins the curb, parapet, or sidewalk. Remove excess grout from the leading edge of the screed at these construction joints.
3. Edge joints to be sealed, including dummy joints, as follows:
1. Edge before the initial set or after the final set.
2. If edging before the initial set, use edging tools of the proper radius as shown on the plans.
3. Carefully remove concrete from pouring operations on adjacent pours to achieve the required rounded edge.
4. If edging after the final set, allow the joints to harden. After at least 12 hours, grind joints to approximate the plan radius either by hand or by mechanically operated grinding stones.
5. To achieve full and uniform bearing, finish areas that are recessed for receiving joint members.

# Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# 9. Finish bridge decks as follows:

1. As soon as the concrete is hard enough and standing water and moisture sheen disappear, give the concrete a final finish by belting, brooming, or dragging.
- Belt longitudinally using a wet canvas belt. Limit belting to spans no longer than 40 ft. (12 m).
- Drag transversely or longitudinally with a wet burlap drag.
- Broom transversely using a stiff-bristled broom.
2. Finish the following areas carefully:
- Gutter lines
- Joints
- Drains
3. After belting, dragging, or brooming and when shown on the plans, groove the bridge deck and approach slabs perpendicular to the center line as follows:
1. Do not begin grooving until the bridge deck is cured according to Subsection 500.3.05.Z, Cure Concrete.
2. If necessary, groove in conjunction with planing required to make the surface corrections specified in Subsection 500.3.06.D, Bridge Deck Surface Check. Wait until the concrete is hard enough to support the equipment without distorting.
3. Cut grooves into the hardened concrete using a mechanical saw device capable of producing grooves 0.125 in. (3 mm) wide, 0.125 in. (3 mm) deep, and 0.50 in. (13 mm) apart, center-to-center.
4. Extend the grooves across the slab to within 1ft. (300 mm) of the gutter lines.
5. Do not groove within 3 in. (75 mm) of bridge joints, including “dummy” joints detailed in the plans.

# U. Place Concrete Parapet on Bridge Decks

Place concrete barrier or parapets on bridge decks. The slip form method with an approved self-propelled extrusion machine as specified in Section 621 is optional.

# V. Place Seal Concrete

Deposit concrete in water only when required by the Plans or when considered necessary by the Engineer. When depositing the seal concrete, follow these guidelines:

- Keep the water as motionless as possible.
- Place the concrete continuously from beginning to end.
- Ensure that the concrete surface remains as horizontal as possible.

Place seal concrete as follows:

1. Place seal concrete carefully in a compacted mass as near to its final position as possible using a tremie, a bottom dump bucket, or other approved means.
- Use tremies to place seal concrete as follows:
1. Support tremies so that the discharge end can move freely over the entire top surface of the work.
2. Support tremies so that they can lower rapidly to stop or retard the flow of concrete.
3. At the beginning of the work, close the discharge end to keep water out of the tube.
4. Keep the tube sealed.
5. Keep the tremie tube full to the bottom of the hopper.
6. When dumping a batch into the hopper, induce concrete flow by slightly raising the discharge end and keeping it within the previously deposited concrete. This maintains a seal and forces the concrete to flow into position by hydraulic head.

# Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# W. Pour CS Concrete

Pour CS concrete as follows:

1. Meet CS concrete depth and surface finish requirements.
- Ensure that the minimum depth is the same as shown on the plans.
- Do not vary the depth variation more than 1 in. (25 mm).
- Ensure that the surface finish is generally smooth and uniform.
- Smooth or fill float marks, voids, and other deformities exceeding 1/2 in. (13 mm) before placing approach slabs.
2. To prevent bonding:
1. Lay clean polyethylene sheeting uniformly over the CS concrete in the approach slab area before placing the slabs.
2. Use new, unused polyethylene sheeting free of holes, rips, and tears.
3. Use polyethylene bond-breaking material at least 8 mils (0.2 mm) thick with an overlap of at least 6 in. (150 mm).
3. Maintain polyethylene sheeting in good condition throughout the construction process. Repair or replace sheeting deemed unsatisfactory as directed by the Engineer.
4. Cure CS concrete with the polyethylene sheeting used for bond breaking.

# X. Pour Concrete in Cold Weather

When pouring concrete in cold weather, keep the concrete temperature at the point of delivery at least 50 °F (10 °C). Do not use accelerator-containing chlorides.

Mix and pour concrete in cold weather as follows:

1. Keep concrete materials at the right temperatures.
- Do not use materials in concrete mix that contain frozen lumps.
- Do not incorporate water and aggregates into the mix with temperatures more than 150 °F (65 °C).
- If aggregates or water temperatures are above 100 °F (40 °C), discharge the aggregates and water into the mixer and allow the temperatures to equalize before adding the cement.
- Heat aggregate with steam, hot water coils, or other methods that do not damage the aggregates. Do not heat aggregates with direct flame.

---

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# 2. Protect the poured concrete.

- Keep concrete above 50 °F (10 °C) for at least 72 hours after placement.
- Protect concrete from freezing for 6 days after placement.

# Y. Pour Concrete in Hot Weather

Reduce hazards and difficulties related to placing and finishing concrete in hot weather before pouring. The Engineer may require measures to prevent concrete workability reduction, losses from cement hydration, evaporation, drying, or elevated concrete temperatures.

# 1. Place Concrete

Cool forms and reinforcement with water immediately before placing concrete. Meet the minimum placement rates specified in Subsection 500.3.05.P, Table 5—Minimum Placement Rates for Bridges, Culverts, and Retaining Walls.

# 2. Keep Concrete Cool

Keep concrete cool as follows:

- Keep the concrete used for construction at no more than 90 °F (32.2 °C) when measured at the point of discharge from the delivery unit.
- If the concrete temperature might exceed 90 °F (32.2 °C) during concrete placement, begin placement when the air temperature cools if the Engineer requires.
- Cool the aggregates by fogging or other means that do not affect moisture content.
- Use chipped or crushed ice in the mix as a portion of the mixing water on a pound (kilogram) basis. If using ice, ensure that the ice melts before the batch is discharged from the mixing unit.
- If necessary, cool water by refrigeration to provide a lower concrete temperature.

# 3. Finish Concrete

Do not “splash on” water to aid screeding or finishing operations. For bridge decks, fog the surface when required, according to Subsection 500.3.05.Z.3, Bridge Deck Curing. If needed, use wind screens to prevent thermal or shrinkage cracks caused by rapid concrete surface drying.

# Z. Cure Concrete

Concrete curing is an integral part of the concrete placement operation. Improperly cured concrete will be considered defective. If the Engineer determines that curing procedures do not comply with these Specifications, stop placing concrete. Resume concrete placement after taking remedial measures to ensure proper curing.

Begin curing unformed surfaces when the water sheen disappears from the surface or immediately after applying the surface finish. Continue curing for 5 days. Cure the formed surfaces after removing the forms. Remove them within 5 days after placing concrete. Continue curing until the concrete is 5 days old (from the time it is poured).

Cure concrete surfaces exposed to air using methods that prevent premature drying or moisture loss. Ensure that curing conditions are the same throughout separate curing areas. Use either or a combination of the two methods specified for curing concrete except bridge decks. Cure bridge decks as described in Subsection 500.3.05.Z.3, Bridge Deck Curing. Cure colored concrete in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.

# 1. General Curing—Supplying Additional Moisture

Do not use a method that causes the concrete to be alternately wet and dry. Cure concrete properly by supplying additional moisture through ponding, sprinkling, or fogging and then retaining the moisture as follows:

- Use cotton mats, burlap, sand, hay, or straw coverings. Cover with at least 2 in. (50 mm) of sand. Cover with at least 3 in. (75 mm) of hay or straw.
- Do not use sawdust or coverings that cause unsightly discoloration of concrete.

651

# Section 500 — Concrete Structures

1. Place coverings after completing the finishing operations when there is no danger of surface damage.
2. Keep coverings moist continuously.

# General Curing—Preventing Moisture Loss

Keep concrete moist before and during the rubbing from the Type III—Rubbed Finish. Start curing immediately after the rub using approved waterproof paper, plastic sheets, or membrane-forming curing compounds, except when curing compounds are prohibited.

# a. Waterproof Paper or Plastic Sheets

Ensure that the sheets and paper meet the requirements of AASHTO C 171 and use them as follows:

- Use the widest possible widths.
- Lap adjacent sheets at least 6 in. (150 mm).
- Seal the laps with tape, mastic, glue, or other approved methods to form a waterproof cover of the entire area.
- Keep the curing material from being displaced by wind.
- Immediately replace or repair sheets or paper that tear, break, or become damaged during the curing period.

# b. Membrane-Forming Curing Compounds

Use as the curing agent AASHTO C 309, membrane-forming curing compounds, Type 1-D, Class A or B, or Type 2, Class A or B, white pigmented. Use the curing agent as follows:

- Do not use membrane-forming curing compounds on bridge decks or prestressed concrete bridge members, or in construction joint areas.
- When the water sheen disappears from the concrete surface, apply the curing compound uniformly to unformed areas.
- Apply the compound to formed surfaces if the forms are removed during the 5-day curing period.
- Cure the areas to be rubbed with liquid membrane-forming compounds for curing concrete, Type 1-D, Class A or B (non-acrylic).
- Apply curing compound with fine-spraying equipment.
- Thoroughly agitate the compounds just before using them.
- Spray the surface again immediately after the first application at right angles to the first application. Apply at least 1 gal (1 L) for each 150 ft.² (3.7 m²) of surface.
- Do not apply curing compound to the following:
- - Joints where a concrete bond is required
- Reinforcement steel
- Joints where joint sealer will be placed

Close the surface to pedestrian or vehicular traffic for 7 days unless the surface is protected by planks, plywood, or a layer of sand at least 1 in. (25 mm) thick. Do not place this protection until at least 12 hours after applying the curing compound.

---

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# 3. Bridge Deck Curing

Cure bridge deck concrete as follows:

1. Immediately after the water sheen disappears and the surface finish is applied, fog the surface to keep a film of water on the surface.
2. If surface damage occurs, delay fogging.
3. Keep the surface wet until after applying the sheet curing covers.
4. Thoroughly soak curing covers on the fabric side.
5. As soon as the concrete sets enough to prevent damage, apply the covers with the white-poly side up.
6. Use two-layer sheet curing material for bridge concrete according to AASHTO C 171. For the bottom layer, use a polyethylene film. For the top layer, use a white, burlap polyethylene sheet or a white, co-polymer-coated, absorbent, non-woven synthetic fabric.
7. Ensure that sheet curing material for bridge concrete meets Specification requirements for reflection and moisture retention and has no holes or tears.
8. Use enough sheet curing material to cover the deck surface.
9. Place the curing covers so that adjoining sheets overlap at least 18 in. (450 mm).
10. Weight all laps and side edges to prevent cover displacement before curing is completed.
11. Weight and overlap covers so the curing sheets maintain intimate contact with the concrete surface.
12. If there is no moisture under the curing covers during the 5-day curing period, apply additional moisture.

# 4. Parapet, Sidewalk, End Post, and Curb Face Curing

The surface of parapets, sidewalk, end post, and horizontal and vertical faces of curbs are not considered part of the bridge deck. Cure these structures using the general curing methods in Subsections 500.3.05.Z.1, General Curing—Supplying Additional Moisture, and 500.3.05.Z.2, General Curing—Preventing Moisture Loss, unless the surfaces will receive a special surface coating (Subsection 500.3.05.AB.4, Type III—Special Surface Coating Finish).

Do not cure surfaces receiving a special surface coating with membrane-forming curing compounds. Do not cure surfaces receiving protection surface treatment (75 percent boiled linseed oil and 25 percent mineral spirits solution) with membrane-forming curing compounds that contain acrylics.

# AA. Prevent Plastic Shrinkage Cracking

Take precautions to prevent plastic shrinkage cracking of concrete by doing the following:

- Provide wind screens
- Provide fogging equipment
- Apply temporary wet coverings before moisture loss begins

The Engineer will evaluate the effects of plastic shrinkage cracks and will require repair of cracks that create structural defects and corrode reinforcement steel.

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# AB. Finish Concrete

Concrete surface finishes are classified according to whether the surfaces are formed or unformed. Refer to Table 6. When other Sections of the Specifications for concrete work state that the requirements of Section 500 apply, finish the concrete according to the other sections.

| Surface  | Finish Type                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Formed   | Type I—Ordinary Formed Surface Finish   |
|          | Type II—Special Formed Surface Finish   |
|          | Type III—Rubbed Finish                  |
|          | Type III—Special Surface Coating Finish |
| Unformed | Type IV–Floated Surface Finish          |
|          | Type V–Sidewalk Finish                  |
|          | Type VI–Stair Tread Finish              |

Except for bridge deck finishes, which are covered in Subsection 500.3.05.T, Place Bridge Deck Concrete, step 9, finish all structural concrete surfaces with one or more of the finishes described here, unless otherwise shown on the plans.

# 1. Type I—Ordinary Formed Surface Finish

Complete formed concrete surfaces with this finish. However, leave concrete exposed directly to sea water undisturbed unless the Engineer requires additional work. See Subsection 500.3.05.V, Place Seal Concrete, step 6.

Achieve a Type I finish as follows:

1. Immediately after removing the forms, remove fins and surface irregularities.
2. Fill or point up the following:
- Cavities produced by forms or ties
- Holes
- Broken corners or edges
- Defects
- Honeycombed edges
3. Remove and patch honeycombed areas to sound concrete.
4. Use patch mortar that consists of the same sand and cement as the concrete. Use the sand and cement in the same ratio as in the concrete.
5. Use epoxy mortars in areas where heat generation and moisture will not decrease patch performance.
6. Cure the patches using one of the general curing methods specified in Subsection 500.3.05.Z.1, General Curing—Supplying Additional Moisture and 500.3.05.Z.2, General Curing—Preventing Moisture Loss.
7. Produce a sound and uniform finish.
8. If the Type I finish is not satisfactory, give the surfaces a Type III—Rubbed Finish where the Engineer considers it necessary to achieve a uniform and pleasing appearance.



---

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# 2. Type II—Special Formed Surface Finish

Give a Type II finish to the following:

- Exposed portions of pipe headwalls and culverts
- Parapets and wingwalls
- Ends of culvert slabs and walls

Achieve a Type II finish as follows:

1. Use a form liner unless the forms are made of plywood or steel.
2. Rub only when necessary if the surface has a pleasing, uniform appearance after completing the Type I finish and blending all pointed and patched areas.
3. If the surface finish is not satisfactory, give surfaces the Type III—Rubbed Finish where the Engineer considers it necessary to achieve a uniform and pleasing appearance.

# 3. Type III—Rubbed Finish

Apply a Type III finish to bridge areas checked in the table of Bridge areas Requiring a Type III Finish, below and to exposed areas of retaining walls, unless the Plans specify otherwise.

Achieve a rubbed finish as follows:

1. Begin the first rub immediately after removing forms, completing the Type I finish, and ensuring that all patches are thoroughly set, but before applying the required curing compound. If finishing is postponed or there is not enough labor to keep it up-to-date, the Engineer will order a stop to any other work until the finishing is satisfactory.
2. Rub chamfered surfaces only once, but not during the first rubbing. Rub chamfered surfaces during either the second or the final rubbing.
3. To rub, wet the moist concrete on the curing surface with a brush and rub with a medium-coarse carborundum stone or equal abrasive until a paste comes to the surface. Keep the entire concrete surface moist during rubbing to assure adequate curing.
4. Continue rubbing until all form marks and projections disappear, leaving a smooth, dense surface with no pits or irregularities.
5. Spread the paste material carefully and uniformly over the entire surface and leave it.
6. No earlier than 24 hours after the first rub, do the final rub with a fine carborundum stone or equal abrasive, leaving a smoothly textured surface that is uniform in color.
7. Finish the final rub before applying protective surface treatment required by the plans.
8. Do not “whitewash” finished areas by using separately mixed grout or paste on the rubbing stone or by spreading it on the surface to be rubbed.
9. Thoroughly clean and blend into the surrounding surfaces any areas that are disfigured by drips from concrete placement or rubbing.

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# 4. Type III—Special Surface Coating Finish

A Type III—Special Surface Coating Finish may be substituted for a Type III—Rubbed Finish. The special surface coating finish consists of either a Class A or a Class B coating system, applied to produce a masonry-like textured finish on concrete surfaces.

For contiguous structures, whether in the same Contract or in separate Contracts, use the same brand of special surface coating. If contiguous structures are in separate contracts, coordinate the Work with the other Contractor so that coating is applied as near as possible to the same time. If contractors cannot coordinate Work, the one who finishes the work last shall use the same brand or shall recoat all contiguous areas to provide a uniform appearance.

Achieve a special surface coating finish as follows:

- a. Ensure that surface coating material meets the requirements of Section 836. Select coating material from the QPL 17.
- b. Do not use form oils that affect the bonding of surface coatings.
- c. Do not use wax-based or other curing compounds incompatible with surface coatings. Have the coating manufacturer or the laboratory determine compatibility.
- d. Use the coating color required in Section 836.
- e. On surfaces that will receive a coating finish, do not cure with membrane-curing compound or remove forms with bond-breaking agents or excessive oil.
- f. Apply coatings as follows:
- • Class A coatings at a rate that develops a 1/16 in. (1.5 mm) thick coating.
- • Apply Class B coatings at a maximum rate of 60 ft.² per gallon (1.5 m² per liter).
- • Ensure that the temperatures of the air, concrete, and compound are above 50 °F (10 °C).
- • Apply a test section as directed by the Engineer to determine the acceptance of a coating under field conditions.
- • Apply the coatings using a method that produces an acceptable finish, such as spraying, rolling, or a combination of these.
- g. Protect coated surfaces from rain or freezing temperatures for 24 hours after application.
- h. Ensure that the final coating produces a smoothly textured surface that is uniform in color, thickness, and appearance.
- i. Remove and reapply coatings that chip, crack, blister, peel, or present an unsatisfactory appearance.
- j. If the final appearance is unsatisfactory, apply a rubbed finish to slip-formed and formed walls and barriers.

# 5. Type IV—Floated Surface Finish

Use a Type IV finish only on the horizontal surfaces of the following:

- • Curbs and sidewalks
- • Tops of caps and footings
- • Surface of slope paving
- • Other similar structures

Apply the Type IV finish as follows:

- a. After compacting the surface and screeding to the correct cross sections, float the surface with a wood float.
- b. While floating the surface, bring enough mortar to the surface to achieve the desired finish, but do not reduce the wearing quality of the surface.
- c. Make the final finish with a wood float or stiff-bristle broom.
- d. If brooming, make the marks transverse to the traffic.

# Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# 6. Type V—Sidewalk Finish

Apply a Type V finish as follows:

1. After placing and compacting the concrete, strike it off and give it a Type IV finish.
2. Use an edging tool on all edges and along expansion joints unless the Plans require chamfers.
3. Mark off sidewalk surfaces in blocks with suitable grooving tools when required by the plans or the Engineer.
4. Extend the rubbed finish on the traffic face of the curb to include the horizontal area of sidewalk between the curb corner and the longitudinal sidewalk groove.

# 7. Type VI—Stair Tread Finish

Achieve a Type IV finish using a stiff-bristled broom.

# AC. Remove Forms

Do not remove forms and their supports, including falsework, until the Engineer approves. Use a removal method approved by the Engineer. Approval does not relieve responsibility for the safety of the Work.

# 1. Form Removal Time

Use a removal time shown on the Plans or specified by the Engineer. Use Table 7 to help establish when forms can be removed safely. However, do not count days where the temperature at any time during the day is at or below 40 °F (4 °C), unless the cold weather concrete protective measures described in Subsection 500.1.03.G, Cold Weather Concrete Curing and Protection Plan were used.

| Form                                                                  | Time Required  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Bottom of beams                                                       | 10 days        |
| Bottom of caps, trestle pile bents                                    | 4 days         |
| Bottom of all other caps                                              | 7 days         |
| Overhangs and slabs, including culverts                               | 7 days         |
| Columns and retaining walls                                           | 18 to 48 hours |
| Sides of beams, posts, rails, caps, footings, wingwalls, and parapets | 12 to 24 hours |
| Bottoms of cast-in-place rails and diaphragms                         | 48 hours       |
| Front face of curbs                                                   | 3 hours        |

If using high-early strength concrete, the Engineer may reduce the time limitations if the concrete develops satisfactory strengths.

# 2. Form Removal Method

Remove forms and falsework without injuring the concrete surface or overstressing the concrete members. Ensure that the stress from the weight of the removal process is transferred gradually and uniformly to the concrete.

At the Contractor’s request, time of removal may be controlled by field tests on cylinders, subject to the following conditions:

1. No tests will be performed until concrete is at least 3 days old.
2. Required strengths will be shown on the Plans, as noted elsewhere in these Specifications, or as determined by the Engineer.
3. The Engineer may specify a minimum time in conjunction with minimum strength requirements.
4. Falsework and forms for culverts may be removed at such time as 75% of the concrete design strength is achieved.

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

AD. Apply Protective Surface Treatment

When the Plans specify a protective surface treatment, apply a boiled linseed oil mixture of 75 percent boiled linseed oil and 25 percent mineral spirits by volume to the concrete surfaces. Use linseed oil that meets the requirements of ASTM D 260, Type I or Type II. Use a quality commercial mineral spirit that passes infrared spectroscopic analysis to the satisfaction of the laboratory. Unless otherwise noted on the Plans or the manufacturer’s recommendations, apply the mixture as a preservative seal coat to the top surfaces of bridge decks, curbs, and sidewalks and to the inside vertical faces of curbs, parapets, and end posts. Protect metal handrailing and metal handrail posts from treatment.

Apply the protective surface treatment as follows:

CAUTION: Because the linseed oil-petroleum spirits mixture has a low flash point and is readily flammable, protect the mixture from fire, especially cigarettes and sparks. Prohibit traffic from the treated area until the Engineer determines the concrete has regained its dry appearance.

1. Do not place the protective surface treatment until concrete work, including final rubbing, is completed and expansion joint sealing compound is placed.
2. Do not apply the treatment until the concrete is at least 14 days old.
3. Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, apply the treatment when the temperature of the concrete and air is at least 50 °F (10 °C).
4. Apply in time to allow the treatment to dry thoroughly before allowing traffic, including haul traffic, on the structure. If the structure meets the following exceptions, apply the treatment after using the structure for hauling.
- Temperature limitations prohibit application. The Engineer will send a written notification to the Contractor (or Bridge Contractor) if temperature requirements prohibit application.
- The structure is absolutely required for hauling to complete a Contract. Request a written approval from the Engineer if hauling across a structure before the treatment is placed.
5. If applying the treatment after using the structure for hauling, thoroughly clean the surfaces to be treated to allow the treatment to penetrate completely.
6. If there are separate bridge and roadway Contracts, have the roadway Contractor clean the surfaces immediately upon request by the Engineer.
7. Prepare the surface for the treatment as follows:
1. Clean off oil, grime, and loose particles that prevent the mixture from penetrating.
2. Ensure that the concrete surfaces have at least 48 hours to dry after rainfall or wet cleaning operations.
3. Immediately before applying the treatment, direct an air blast over the surfaces to remove dust.
4. Mask the exposed plates of joints.
8. Apply the mixture by hand or by spraying in one application at the rate of 1 gal (1 L) of mixture per 37.5 yd² (8.5 m²).
1. Thoroughly clean the inside of spraying equipment before putting the surface treatment in.
2. Keep spray nozzles within 18 in. (600 mm) of the concrete unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, plans, or manufacturer.

# Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# AE. Apply Graffiti-Proof Coating

When the Plans specify a graffiti-proof coating, apply the coating system to concrete surfaces or over special surface coatings. Use material that complies with Section 838.

Apply the coating as follows:

1. Clean loose particles, dirt, grease, oil, and other foreign particles off the surface.
2. Apply the coating according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for:
- Weather conditions
- Material preparation
- Coating application
- Number of coats

# AF. Expose New Concrete to Loads

Prohibit dead or live loads during or after construction except as described in this section. If using high early strength concrete, the Engineer may reduce time limitations if the concrete develops adequate strength.

# 1. Dead Loads on the Substructure

After pouring footings, do not begin work on columns or piers for at least 12 hours. After pouring columns, do not begin cap construction for at least 24 hours. Do not place beams on caps or place falsework and forming for concrete T-Beam construction before the cap concrete reaches a minimum strength of 2,500 psi (17 MPa).

# 2. Dead Loads on the Superstructure

If necessary, stockpile construction materials on decks within a complete unit (a simple span or continuous or cantilever unit) if the following conditions exist:

- The deck concrete of the complete unit reaches its 28-day cylinder strength.
- The deck concrete is at least 10 days old.
- The curbs are at least 5 days old.

The Engineer must approve the location, height, and spread of the loads. On composite-design bridges (those that have prestressed concrete beams or steel beams with shear connectors), do not pour curbs, parapets, or sidewalks until the deck concrete reaches a minimum strength of 1,500 psi (10 MPa) or is at least 3 days old.

# 3. Dead Loads on Concrete Box Culverts

Do not backfill any section of a concrete box culvert until the last concrete placed in that section is at least 14 days old, unless early cylinder breaks indicate otherwise. If early cylinder breaks indicate that design strength has been achieved, backfill sections of culverts when the concrete placed last is at least 7 days old.

# 4. Live Loads—Pouring Equipment

Do not allow power-operated concrete buggies to cross a deck until the concrete reaches a minimum strength of 1,500 psi (10 MPa) or is at least 3 days old. Allow hand-operated buggies to cross after the concrete is 24 hours old.

---

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

5. Live Loads—Mixing and Lifting Equipment

Do not place mixers on a deck in a complete unit (a simple span or continuous or cantilever unit) until the deck concrete of the complete unit reaches its 28-day cylinder strength and is at least 10 days old. When deck concrete reaches its 28-day cylinder strength and is at least 10 days old, allow mixer trucks on the unit during the curb concrete pour only if the pour is completed within 45 minutes of being started. Do not allow any equipment on the unit for 5 days after curb pours. The Engineer may allow concrete placement procedures that use heavy lifting equipment on the decks if the following conditions exist:

- The deck concrete reaches its 28-day cylinder strength.
- The deck concrete is at least 14 days old.
- The curbs on the deck are at least 10 days old.

6. Live Loads—Hauling over Bridges

Use a new bridge for hauling only if no other practical haul routes are available and only if the Engineer permits it.

a. Govern hauling by the restrictions and requirements listed in Table 8. If any of the restrictions and requirements are violated, the Engineer will limit loads to the following:

- Single 32,000 lb. (14 515 kg) axle when the bridge design loading is HL-93 or HS 20-44
- Single 24,000 lb. (10 886 kg) axle when the bridge design loading is HS 15-44 or H 15-44

| Axle Criteria                            | Bridge Design Loading     |                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
|                                          | HL-93 or HS 20-44 Loading | HS 15-44 or H 15-44     |
| Maximum Axle Load Per Axle               | 60,000 lbs. (27 216 kg)   | 44,000 lbs. (19 958 kg) |
| Maximum Axle Load on Dual Axles Per Axle | 45,000 lbs. (20 412 kg)   | 33,000 lbs. (14 969 kg) |
| Maximum Total Load                       | 100,000 lbs. (45 360 kg)  | 73,000 lbs. (33 113 kg) |

b. Ensure that bridge concrete, including curbs, parapets, barriers and sidewalks, is at least 14 days old and has a minimum compressive strength of 3,000 psi (20 MPa).

c. Apply the linseed oil special protective treatment, if required see (Subsection 500.3.05.AD, Apply Protective Surface Treatment).

d. After applying the protective treatment (if required), apply water-repellent silicone materials to the handrail, handrail posts, end posts, and curb faces before hauling begins.

e. Do not allow more than one vehicle at a time on a simple or multiple-span unit.

f. Ensure that vehicle speeds, loaded or unloaded, do not exceed 5 miles/hr. (8 km/hr.) when the following loads occur:

- Bridges designed for HL-93 or HS 20-44 Loading:
- - Loads on single axles exceed 32,000 lbs. (14 515 kg)
- Loads on each dual axle exceed 24,000 lbs. (10 886 kg)

Bridges designed for HS 15-44 or H 15-44 loading:

When axle loads do not exceed these loads, ensure that vehicle speeds are 15 mph (24 kph) or less.

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

g. Place temporary guides on beams so wheels will track directly.

h. Keep earth approaches smooth and level with the bridge floor or approach slab to minimize impact. Stabilize sandy and other unstable soils (at no expense to the Department) with crushed stone or other suitable material for at least 10 ft. (3 m) from the end of the bridge or approach slab.

i. Protect the ends of bridges or approach slabs with a timber strip at least 4 in. (100 mm) wide, cut to rest on either the paving rest of the bridge end or the pavement subgrade at the end of the approach slab. Keep the strip in place for protection during incidental hauling. Remove it before constructing the adjacent pavement. Keep the top of each timber strip flush with the top of the concrete surface. Fit the strip tightly against the end of the bridge or approach slab. If the timber strip is displaced, stop hauling until the strip is reset or replaced.

j. Clean spills off the bridge floor.

# AG. Complete Corrective Work

After the Department gives the deck surface a Ride Quality Test described in Subsection 500.3.06.E, Ride Quality Test, complete corrective work at no cost to the Department and before doing the final surface texturing. Complete corrective work as follows:

1. Plane the deck according to Section 431.
2. Limit concrete removal by planing so that the final bar cover is not less than the Plan cover minus 1/2 in. (13 mm).
3. If the final bar cover limits cannot be met, perform the corrective work as directed by the Engineer.
4. Ensure that the final riding surface complies with this Specification and the requirements for a grooved finish.
5. If necessary, use a bump grinder to correct bumps with a profile base line of 5 ft. (1.5 m) or less.
6. Have planed decks retested as described in Subsection 500.3.06.E, Ride Quality Test, to ensure that the ride quality meets the requirements of this Specification.

# AH. Plane the Deck

The Contractor shall schedule the ride quality test at least 7 days before needed by contacting the Office of Materials and Testing, Concrete Branch. Ensure that the area to be tested is clean and clear of obstructions. When possible, delay expansion joint installation and temporarily bridge the joint to operate Lightweight Profiler and planing equipment across the joint.

# Planing responsibilities are shown in Table 9:

| Area Planed                                           | Person Responsible |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Bridge decks                                          | Bridge Contractor  |
| Approach slabs constructed under the bridge Contract  | Bridge Contractor  |
| Approach slabs constructed under the roadway Contract | Roadway Contractor |

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

AI. Perform Retaining Wall Incidentals

Retaining wall incidentals are as follows:

1. Drainage
Unless otherwise shown on the Plans or in the Special Provisions, ensure that drainage for retaining walls is either Alternate A or Alternate B on Georgia Standards 4941B and 4949 Series. Ensure that the Number 10 concrete sand complies with Subsection 801.2.02, Fine Aggregate for Portland cement Concrete of All Types and for Mortar and has a permeability coefficient of at least 100 ft. (30 m) per day. The Engineer may waive the grading requirement for Number 10 concrete sand if the permeability coefficient of the material does not exceed 500 ft. (150 m) per day. Omit the drainage blanket and stone for retaining walls only when the height does not exceed 6 ft. (1.8 m). When the Plans specify different drainage details, furnish, place, or build the various items according to the plan requirements.
2. Waterproofing and Damp proofing
When waterproofing and damp proofing are specified in the Plans, comply with the requirements of Sections 530 and 531.

AJ. Place Utility Installation Hardware

When the Plans require placing utility installation hardware, the utility company involved will furnish the items. Place the items as directed on the plans or Shop Drawings. All other work, including painting as required, is the utility company’s responsibility.

AK. Widen Bases and Pavement

When using narrow sections of Portland cement concrete to widen existing bases or bases and pavements, use Class B concrete as shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer.

AL. Open the Structure to Traffic

Open a structure to traffic other than haul traffic after all concrete in the decks, parapets, or curbs (sidewalks) reaches its 28-day cylinder strength and is at least 14 days old.

# 500.3.06 Quality Acceptance

A. Strength Requirement Tests

When job site test specimens fail to meet the strength requirements in the Table 1—Concrete Mix Table, determine the Final Acceptance or rejection of concrete in place by coring or non-destructive testing. At the Contractor’s request, the Department will determine the removal time for forms by conducting field tests on cylinders. Tests are subject to the following:

1. Tests will be performed when the concrete is at least three days old.
2. The Plans will show the required strengths.
3. At the Contractor’s request, the Engineer may specify a minimum time with minimum strength requirements.

B. Honeycombed Area Check

If there are honeycombed areas that extend beyond the reinforcement steel, the Engineer may reject the entire pour with the honeycombed area.



---

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# C. Bridge Deck Slab Concrete Inspection

The Engineer will carefully observe the construction methods used during all phases of the bridge deck slab construction. These phases include the following:

- Metal form installation
- Reinforcement location and fastening
- Concrete item composition
- Mixing procedures
- Concrete placement and vibration
- Bridge deck finishing

Provide the needed facilities for the Engineer to safely and conveniently inspect the concrete.

The concrete inspection procedure is as follows:

1. After the deck concrete has been in place for at least two days, the Engineer will sound a hammer on at least two areas of the deck for each slab pour. This test checks for concrete soundness and form bonding. The two areas will encompass at least 10 percent of the total area of the deck pour.
2. The Engineer will sound other areas of the deck randomly.
3. If the Engineer doubts the soundness of an area, or if the Engineer decides that the concrete placement procedures used call for an inspection of the underside of the deck, remove at least one section of the forms for each span in the Contract.
4. Remove the form section after the pour is strong enough and when the Engineer desires to provide visual evidence that the concrete mix and the placement procedures are acceptable.
5. Remove another form section if the Engineer decides changes in the concrete mix or in the placement procedures warrant additional inspection.
6. Where form sections are removed, do not necessarily replace the forms, but repair the adjacent metal forms and supports neatly and securely.
7. When the form is removed, the Engineer will examine the concrete surfaces for cavities, honeycombing, and other defects.
8. If the Engineer finds irregularities but determines that the irregularities do not justify rejection of the Work, repair the concrete as the Engineer directs and give it an ordinary surface finish according to the Contract Specifications.
9. If the concrete where the form is removed is not acceptable, remove additional forms as necessary to inspect and repair the slab.
10. Modify the construction methods as required by the Engineer to create satisfactory slab concrete.
11. Remove or repair all unsatisfactory concrete as the Engineer directs. If the construction methods used and the inspection results indicate that the slabs have sound concrete, the Engineer may moderate the amount of random sounding and form removal after a substantial amount of slab has been constructed and inspected.

# D. Bridge Deck Surface Check

After the final strike-off of the concrete and as close behind the final strike-off as possible, the Engineer will check the surface with a 10 ft. (3 m) straightedge. Attach the straightedge to a broom-type handle for easy control and use. Bridges and approach slabs must meet a 1/8 in. in 10 ft. (3 mm in 3 m) straightedge check made longitudinally and transversely.



---

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

# E. Ride Quality Test

After the bridge decks and approach slabs are completed, the Contractor will contact the Department’s Office of Materials and Testing, Concrete Branch to schedule to have a Ride Quality Test performed using the Lightweight Profiler and a profile index value determined according to GDT 134.

The Department will conduct the test as follows:

1. Obtain Profile Index Values for all bridge decks and approach slabs not detailed to include an overlay.
2. Bridges and approach slabs must meet the straightedge check limits described in Subsection 500.3.06.D, Bridge Deck Surface Check.
3. Obtain profiles in the wheel paths and in safety areas to within 6 ft. (1.8 m) of barrier or curb lines.
4. Average the profile index values for bridge decks including the approach slabs for the left and right wheel path for each lane. The average value must not exceed 15 in./mile (235 mm/km) for each lane.

After the test is complete, correct individual bumps or depressions that exceed 2/10 in. (5 mm) from the blanking band on the profiler trace. The deck surface must then meet a 1/8 in. in 10 ft. (3 mm in 3 m) straightedge check made transversely. Correct bridge decks and approach slabs that do not pass the Ride Quality Test as described in Subsection 500.3.05.AG, Complete Corrective Work.

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

B. Payment per Cubic Yard (Meter)

Measurement limits on payment per cubic yard (meter) are:

1. Bridges, Concrete Culverts, Headwalls, and Retaining Walls
The quantity of concrete measured for payment is the algebraic summation of the Base Pay Quantity and authorized quantity changes. If additional quantities are necessary because of any of the following, these quantities are measured separately for payment:

- Rocks were removed carefully but additional quantities are needed because footing depth and keyway dimension are irregular from unanticipated rock removal.
- Voids or crevices exist within the spread footing area.
- The Engineer authorized filling trenches cut in rock outside footing areas to ease dewatering.

These additional quantities will be paid as filler concrete per cubic yard (meter).
2. Seals

The Engineer will determine how to repair cracks caused by plastic shrinking. Repair cracks at no cost to the Department.

# D. Plan Quantities

For all bridges (except seal concrete), concrete culverts, headwalls, and retaining walls, the quantities shown on the Contract Plans, including Standard Plans, will be considered the Base Pay Quantity. For seal concrete, the Plan quantities are approximate and are for estimating purposes only. The quantities will not be considered as Base Pay Quantities. Calculated additions or deductions will be applied to the Base Pay Quantity when the Engineer makes authorized changes. Changes include, but are not limited to, authorized changes in the following:

- Footing dimensions
- Lengthening or shortening of concrete culverts
- Correcting Plan Quantities
- Dimension errors
- Multi-barrel culvert wall thicknesses
- Lengthening or shortening bridge columns
- Raising or lowering foundations



---

Section 500 — Concrete Structures

Calculations of the Base Pay Quantity and any changes will be made as follows:

1. No deductions will be made for the volume of concrete used by scorings, panels, and chamfers if the individual areas are less than 1 in.² (645 mm²). The volume of concrete in fillets of the same area will be neglected.
2. The volume of structural steel and of steel and concrete piling encased in concrete will be deducted.
3. The volume of timber piling encased in concrete will be deducted on the basis of 0.8 ft.³/linear foot (0.07 m³/linear meter) of pile.
4. No deduction will be made for the volume of concrete displaced by the following:
- Steel reinforcement
- Shear connectors
- Floor drains (unless they are paid for as separate Pay Items)
- Incidentals such as expansion material
- Joint sealing compound
- Utility thimbles and hangers

# E. Filler Concrete

Filler concrete, measured as described in Subsection 500.4.01.B.1, Bridges, Concrete Culverts, Headwalls, and Retaining Walls, will be paid at 40 percent of the Contract Price per cubic meter for Class A Concrete or Class AA Concrete.

# F. Seal Concrete

If there is no Contract Price for seal concrete, payment will be per cubic yard (meter), measured as described in Subsection 500.4.01.B.2, Seals, and will be paid at 60 percent of the Contract Price per cubic yard (meter) for Class A concrete.

# G. Lump Sum Payment Adjustments

Adjust the payment as follows:

1. Authorized Change Adjustments
When authorized changes are made as described in Subsection 500.5.01.D, Plan Quantities, the lump sum payment may be adjusted on a pro rata basis or according to Section 104 and as determined by the Engineer. The Plans show tabulated quantities as a service. This does not relieve any responsibility to conform to plan details.
2. Optional Plan Feature Adjustments
If exercising an optional Plan feature, the Base Pay Quantity will not be changed if it is the only quantity change involved. However, if other changes are necessary, the quantity change resulting from the optional feature will be considered in the necessary quantity adjustments.
3. Falsework for Post-Tensioned Box Girder Bridge Adjustments
When the falsework is completed for post-tensioned box girder bridges, 20 percent of the Lump Sum superstructure concrete price will be paid. Additional payments made as the concrete is placed must be adjusted for the payment for falsework. In other words, payment for concrete placed will be based on 80 percent of the superstructure bid price.
4. When Metal Deck Forms are used and have been placed, payment in the amount of 5% of the Lump Sum Superstructure Concrete price will be made. For Post-Tensioned Box Girder Bridges, this percentage (5%) will apply to that part of the superstructure.

# B. Shop Drawings

Prepare Shop Drawings for structural steel and other metal materials to be fabricated. Show the details necessary for shop fabrication and field erection.

# 1. Description

Use the standard sheet size of the Department’s Bridge Office. Submit at least two complete sets of preliminary prints marked NOT FOR FIELD USE to the Department’s Bridge and Structural Design Engineer (the Bridge Engineer) for review before fabricating materials.

As an option, shop drawings may be submitted on plan sheet sizes of 12 in. x 18 in. (305 mm x 457 mm) or 11 in. x 17 in. (279 mm x 432 mm) for review and approval. Information contained on these sheets must be legible.

After shop drawings have been approved, submit an electronic file that is compatible with Bentley Microstation J (Version 7) Cadd operating system, or an electronic file in Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (.pdf) to the Engineer. For bridges carrying railroads only, after shop drawings have been approved, submit one full size set of reproducible drawings to the Department.

# 2. Review Process

After the preliminary prints have been reviewed and revisions have been made, submit 5 or more complete sets of the final drawings to the Bridge Engineer. The Bridge Engineer will mark each drawing with a conditional approval stamp and return one stamped set to the fabricator. Furnish the Bridge Engineer with as many additional sets of final prints as required.

The Bridge Engineer’s review and conditional approval of Shop Drawings is a service for the Contractor. The Department assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the drawings, and the Contractor will not be relieved of any responsibility for conforming to the specifications and plans.

# 3. Railway Structures

For structures carrying railway traffic and for other structures when specifically designated, furnish the Bridge Engineer a full set of permanent reproducibles of the final Shop Drawings.

# 4. Welded Construction

On Shop Drawings for welded construction, use the standard welding symbols of the American Welding Society. Explain special conditions in notes or details. Show the sequence and techniques for areas where shrinkage stress and distortion control is necessary.

# 5. Changes and Substitutions

Do not change a Shop Drawing after it has been conditionally approved unless the Bridge Engineer gives written consent. List and symbolize revisions on each drawing.

Obtain written consent from the Bridge Engineer before substituting materials with dimensions and weights other than those shown on the plans. Make changes associated with an approved substitution at no expense to the Department.

# 6. Alternate Locations of Splices and Connections

If splices or connections are desired at locations other than those shown on the plans, submit a proposal and Shop Drawings to the Bridge Engineer to get written approval before proceeding.

# 7. Steel Identification

Upon request, furnish an affidavit certifying the identification of steel is maintained throughout fabrication.

On the Shop Drawings, show the grade of steel to be used and identify each piece. Give pieces made of different types or grades of steel different assembly or erection marks.

Maintain the identity of the mill test report number when assembly-marking individual pieces and when giving cutting instructions to the shop.

# C. Fabrication Schedule

Ensure that the fabricator submits a proposed fabrication schedule to the State Materials and Research Engineer that includes the following:

- Correct project number, including county
- Bridge number
- Starting date
- Estimated completion date

---

# Section 501 — Steel Structures

# D. Quality Control Program

Before fabrication begins, submit the fabricator’s written Quality Control program to the Office of Materials and Research for approval. This program and its personnel will be subject to verification when the Department’s Materials and Research Engineer deems necessary. Even with a State inspection, continue to perform Quality Control (QC) on all nonfracture-critical and fracture-critical members and components.

# E. Mill Orders and Shipping Statements

Furnish the number of copies of mill orders and shipping statements covering fabricated materials and related miscellaneous materials the Engineer directs. Show the weights of individual members on the statements.

# F. Mill Test Reports

Furnish the Engineer two certified, legible copies of mill test reports that show the results of physical tests and complete ladle analyses for each heat and grade of steel ordered. Refer to the ASTM designation of tests used. Furnish mill test reports at no expense to the Department.

# G. Welding Procedures

Before structural steel fabrication begins, submit welding procedures to the Engineer for review and approval.

# H. Electrode Testing

Furnish a manufacturer’s certification showing that the material requirements used for manufacturing the tested electrodes and furnished electrodes were the same for each lot of electrodes on the Project.

# I. Falsework

If required, prepare and submit falsework plans for the Engineer’s review. Continue to assume the responsibility to produce safe falsework. When erection is completed, remove falsework to the Engineer’s satisfaction.

# J. Camber Diagram

Furnish the Engineer a diagram showing the camber at each splice point for each girder. Base the diagram on measurements taken during shop assembly. In the case of partial shop assembly, base the camber diagram on theoretical calculated values.

1. Fasteners. Use fasteners in their lubricated, as-delivered condition. Use black bolts oily to the touch. With galvanized assemblies, use nuts with a clean, dry lubricant that contrasts with the color of the zinc coating.
2. Self-Lubricating Bronze Plates. Use cast-bronze plates of the type shown on the Shop Drawings, unless otherwise shown on the plans.

# 501.2.01 Delivery, Storage, and Handling

1. Fasteners
Store fasteners to protect them from dirt and moisture. Take from storage only enough fasteners to install and tighten during a work shift. Return unused fasteners to protective storage at the end of the shift.
2. Structural Steel Members
1. Delivery
Load, transport, and unload girders without excessive stress or damage. The Engineer will observe the delivery of beams or girders and will immediately notify the Contractor of damaged or unsatisfactory material before the material is unloaded or as soon as the damage is discovered. If members are improperly handled, the Inspector may withhold or remove the final stamp of approval. Use Figure 1, Figure 2, and the following loading specifications and shipping details for truck, rail, or barge transportation.

1. Use chains and chain binders to secure beams and girders during shipping only if using a protective shield to prevent gouging flanges and if providing adequate bracing to prevent bending the top flanges.
2. Keep the center of gravity of beams, girders, and heavy haunch sections as low as possible.
3. Use access roads to safely deliver beams and girders to the site.

# 2. Storage

Handle structural steel during storage in the same manner as during fabrication. See Subsection 501.2.01.B.2.a, General and Subsection 501.2.01.B.3, Handling.

# a. General

Place beams and girders with their webs vertical. Shore, brace, or clamp beams and girders to resist lateral forces during storage. Keep steel free from dirt, oil, grease, or other contaminants and protect it from corrosion. Pitch trough sections to provide water drainage.

Do not stack beams and girders on each other.

Place long members on supports close together to prevent damage from deflection.

The Engineer will observe the storage and handling of beams or girders and ensure that they are satisfactory before erection.

# b. Supports

The material on which the beams and girder supports are placed shall be firm, well-drained, unyielding, and not allow excessive or uneven settlement when the supports are loaded.

Store beams and girders on platforms, skids, or other supports on the ground above high-water elevation.

Shore supports with firm, well-drained unyielding material. Use material that settles evenly when the supports are loaded.

Support beams and girders adjacent to the bearings and at intervals of no more than 25 ft. (7.5 m). Use enough intermediate supports to prevent damage from deflection.

# 3. Handling

Handle steel members with clamps, plate hooks, or devices to avoid nicks, gouges, or depressions. Do not use chains and chokers to handle steel members unless using a protective shield between the chain or choker and the member.

# a. Beam and Girder Pick Up

Use spreader bars to lift beams and girders over 50 ft. (15 m) in length.

One-point pickups are allowed for beams and girders less than 50 ft. (15 m) long.

Use two-point pickups so the amount of overhang and distance between hooks does not exceed the distances in the following table:

| Beam Size                                                           | 30 in. (760 mm) | 33 in. (840 mm) | 36 in. (920 mm) | Plate Girders |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| 2-point pick-up distance between hooks linear feet (meters) maximum | 74 (22)         | 80 (24)         | 85 (26)         | 100 (30)      |
| 2-point pick-up overhang linear feet (meters) maximum               | 25 (7)          | 28 (8)          | 30 (9)          | 35 (10)       |

WF = Wide Flange

If using pick-ups that cause long overhangs, attach lines at beam ends to control movement.

# b. Beam and Girder Protection

Keep webs of beams and girders vertical while handling. Never drop, throw, or drag beams and girders.

Do not allow beams or girders to bend about the weak axis, even under their own weight. When shipping beams or girders upside-down, use caution when turning them over for shipment and turning them right-side up at their destination. Use enough blocking and pick-up points to prevent excess stress on the girder.

# 501.3 Construction Requirements

# 501.3.01 Personnel

A.  Fabricators

Employ structural steel fabricators certified under the AISC Certification Program, Category III—Major Steel Bridges.

B.  Welders

Qualify field welders according to ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D 1.5. Employ certified welders who possess a current welding certification card issued by the Department’s Office of Materials and Research.

# 501.3.02 Equipment

A.  Tension Measuring Device

Have a tension measuring device at all job sites where High Tensile-Strength bolts are installed and tightened. Use the tension-measuring device to:

- Confirm the proper snug tight and final installation bolt tension
- Calibrate wrenches properly
- Ensure the bolting crew understands the importance of proper bolt tensioning

At least once a year, have an approved testing agency calibrate the tension-measuring device to confirm its accuracy.

B.  Wrenches

If using the calibrated wrench method to tighten HTS bolts, calibrate the wrench at least once each working day for each diameter, length, and grade of bolt to be installed. Recalibrate the wrench when adding or deleting the air hose, changing compressors, or performing similar tasks.

Use the wrench in job-site tightening under the exact conditions that it was calibrated. Recalibrate wrenches if a significant difference is noted in the surface condition or level of lubrication of the bolt threads, nuts, or washers.

C.  Ovens

Use electric drying ovens approved by the Engineer to dry electrodes according to ANSI/AASHTO/ AWS D 1.5.

D.  Lifting Equipment

Use proper lifting equipment that can carefully handle steel members without bending, twisting, damaging, or excessively stressing parts. Use cranes that have at least a two-part line for lifting.

The Department will terminate shop inspection if lifting equipment is operated or maintained in a hazardous manner.

E.  Erection Equipment

Proposed erection equipment is subject to the Engineer’s review. Even with this review, assume responsibility for providing adequate and safe equipment and for carrying out the work according to the plans and specifications.

Begin erection only after the Engineer’s review.

# 501.3.03 Preparation

A.  Installation Method Testing for Bolted Construction

Before beginning the bolting operation, the Engineer will verify the Contractor’s installation method. Verification will determine if the method used (calibrated wrench or turn-of-nut) will produce the correct bolt tension in the HTS structural bolts of the completed connection.

If the method is successful, the total clamping force of bolts will be transferred to the connected members and will resist slipping through friction.



---

# Section 501 — Steel Structures

Do not use bolts tightened during installation method tests or use other previously used HTS structural bolts in the work.

# 1. Verification Procedures for Both Methods

Test both methods of tightening (calibrated wrench or turn-of-nut) with the following procedures:

1. Select three assemblies (bolt, nut, and washer) from each diameter, length, and grade to be installed.
2. Install each bolt, nut, and washer into the tension-measuring device.
3. Install enough spacers or washers so that at least 3 but not more than 5 full threads are between the nut face and the underside of the bolt head.
4. Use the same type of element (nut or bolt head) as will be used in the work. Place a hardened washer under the turned element.
5. Snug tighten each assembly using the procedure that will be used in the work.
6. After snug tightening, place appropriate marks on the end of the bolt stick out and nut, bolt head and tension calibrator, or drive socket and tension calibrator.

# 2. Calibrated Wrench Method Verification

a. Impact Wrench

1. When using an impact wrench:

b. Manual Torque Wrench

1. When using a manual torque wrench:

# 3. Turn-of-Nut Method Verification

When using the turn-of-nut method, tighten the three assemblies beyond snug tight to the appropriate rotation shown in Table B: Nut Rotation from Snug Tight. Ensure that at this rotation, the minimum bolt tension is 5 to 10 percent higher than the appropriate tension shown in Table A: Required Fastener Tension.

# 501.3.04 Fabrication

A. Straightening Material

Ensure that rolled material is straight to the mill tolerances provided in ASTM A 6/A 6M before it is laid off or worked. Use straightening methods that do not injure the metal. Sharp kinks and bends will be cause for rejection the material.

680

---

Section 501 — Steel Structures

B. Using Stock Material

The fabricator may use stock materials for minor items whose quantity for the Project is less than the minimum required for mill rolling if the following requirements are met:

1. Mill test reports show that the stock material meets the requirements of the specifications.
2. The stock material is identifiable by heat number and mill test report so the Inspector can determine if the material meets the required specification.

Instead of these requirements, the Engineer may take representative stock samples and test them at the Contractor’s expense.

C. Identifying Steel

Provide a system of assembly-marking individual pieces and the issuance of cutting instructions to the shop that will maintain identity of the mill test report number. Before cutting or placing individual pieces of steel in stock for later use, mark the pieces with the following:

- Mill test report number
- Heat number
- Color code, if any

Transfer heat numbers and color codes only in the presence of the Inspector. Color code steel pieces according to ASTM A 6/A 6M specification identification. Establish and record an individual color code for steels not included in the A 6/A 6M specification. If steel is subject to fabrication that might erase a painted color code mark before assembly, stamp it with a steel die or attach a tag.

D. General Procedures

1. Marking Steel. Mark finished beams or girders with the following:
- Erection mark or match mark according to the erection diagram on the shop drawings.
- Weight, if a member weighs more than 3 tons (3 Mg).
2. Edge Planing. Plane sheared edges of plates more than 5/8 in. (16 mm) thick to a depth of 1/4 in. (6 mm).
3. Re-Entrant Cuts. Fillet re-entrant cuts, notch free, to a radius of at least 3/4 in. (19 mm).
4. Oxygen Cutting. Steel may be oxygen-cut if the following is obtained:
- Smooth surface free of notches and cracks
- Accurate profile using a mechanical guide

Ensure that oxygen cutting conforms with AWS D 1.5. Oxygen-cut by hand only where approved. After cutting, round the corners of oxygen-cut surfaces to a 1/16 in. (2 mm) radius by grinding.
5. Cambering. The camber shown on the plans is that required after completely fabricating the member, including attaching cover plates and shear connectors. Do not use cambering methods that will induce stresses that may impair the service life of the member.
1. Obtain camber for plate girders by cutting both edges of the web after the shop web splices are complete and have been inspected.
2. Apply heat no hotter than 1,150 °F (620 °C) to adjust deviations from the camber ordinates (shown on the Shop Drawings) caused by web distortion from either of the following:
- Oxygen cutting
- Weld metal shrinkage
3. Obtain camber for rolled beams with approved heat-cambering methods.

Section 501 — Steel Structures

# 6. Finishing Bearing Surfaces

Ensure that the surface finish of bearings, base plates, and other bearing surfaces in contact with each other or with concrete meets the ANSI surface roughness requirements, defined in ANSI B 46.1 Part 1, as follows:

| Surface                                                                                | Finish Requirement |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Steel slabs                                                                            | ANSI 2,000 (50 μm) |
| Heavy plates in contact in shoes to be welded                                          | ANSI 1,000 (25 μm) |
| Milled ends of compression members and milled or ground ends of stiffeners and fillers | ANSI 500 (12.5 μm) |
| Bridge rollers and rockers                                                             | ANSI 250 (6.3 μm)  |
| Pins and pin holes                                                                     | ANSI 125 (3.2 μm)  |
| Sliding bearings                                                                       | ANSI 125 (125 μm)  |

Finish surfaces that contact metal or masonry as specified below.

1. Sole and Bearing Plates. Ensure that sole and bearing plates have full contact when assembled. Straighten warped or deformed plates before machining; then do one of the following to the surfaces of plates contacting masonry:
1. Machine the surfaces to an ANSI 2,000 (50 μm) surface roughness rating value.
2. Straighten the surfaces so that the maximum clearance under a straightedge placed across the bearing surface in any direction is 1/16 in. (2 mm)
2. Cast Pedestals and Shoes. Machine the surfaces of cast pedestals and shoes that contact metal surfaces.
3. Bearing Assemblies. Finish fabricated bearing assemblies according to Subsection 501.3.04.D.6, Finish Bearing Surfaces. Perform final machining after the assembly is completely fabricated. If the completed assembly must be heat-treated, perform final machining after the heat treatment.
4. Plates in Contact with Elastomeric Pads. Ensure that the plates are straight and free of loose mill scale. Do not machine-finish the surface in contact with the elastomeric pad.
5. Direction of Cut. Machine the faces of movable surfaces and their opposing contact surfaces so that the finish cut is in the direction of the expected movement, unless using non directional finishing equipment.
6. Abutting Joints. In compression members (and tension members when specified on the plans), face the abutting joints and bring them to even bearings. When facing joints is not required, ensure an opening of 1/4 in. (6 mm) or less.

# 7. Annealing and Stress Relieving

After heat treatment, machine-finish, bore, and straighten the structural members required by the plans to be annealed or normalized. Perform full annealing and normalizing according to ASTM A 919 and the following:

1. During heating and cooling, keep the furnace temperature uniform so the temperature difference between any two points on a member does not exceed 100 °F (40 °C).
2. Record each furnace charge to identify the pieces in the charge and show the temperatures and schedule used. The method of recording the treatment operation procedures is subject to the Inspector’s approval.
3. Provide proper instruments, including recording pyrometers, to determine member temperatures in the furnace.

Section 501 — Steel Structures

d. When the Contract requires, stress-relieve welded bridge shoes, pedestals, and other similar weldments according to AWS specifications.

# 8. Component Fabrication

a. Beam and Girder Ends

Fabricate the ends of beams and girders to be vertical in the final erected position, unless otherwise shown on the plans.

b. End Connection Angles

Build end connection angles to the exact length shown on the plans, measured between the heels of the connection angles. The allowed tolerance is plus 0 to minus 1/16 in. (plus 0 to minus 2 mm). Where continuity is required, face end connections. Ensure that the connection angle thickness after facing is no less than 3/8 in. (10 mm) or the amount shown on the plans.

c. Steel Joints

At the shop, shape the plates, angles, or other structural shapes to conform to the section of the concrete deck. Ensure that painting and other fabrication requirements conform to the specifications for these Items.

d. Bent Plates

Ensure that unwelded, cold-bent, load-carrying, rolled steel plates meet the following requirements:

1. The bend lines are at right angles to the rolling direction.
2. The plate will not crack during bending. Minimum bend radii, measured to the concave face of the metal, for all grades of steel used in this specification, are shown in the following table:

| Thickness “T” in Inches (Millimeters) | Minimum Bend Radii |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Up to ½ (12)                          | 2 T                |
| Over 1/2 to 1 (12 to 25)              | 2-1/2 T            |
| Over 1 to 1-1/2 (25 to 38)            | 3 T                |
| Over 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 (38 to 60)        | 3-1/2 T            |
| Over 2-1/2 to 4 (60 to 100)           | 4 T                |

Low-alloy steel in thicknesses over 1/2 in. (12 mm) may require hot bending for small radii. If a shorter radius is essential, bend plates hot at 1,200 °F (650 °C) or less. Ensure that hot-bent plates have bend lines at right angles to the rolling direction.

Round the corners of plates to a radius of 1/16 in. (2 mm) before bending.

e. Stiffeners

Ensure that bearing stiffeners and stiffeners used as supports for concentrated loads have full bearing on the flanges they transmit load to or the flanges they receive load from. Mill or grind the bearing surfaces of stiffeners. On weldable steel in flange compression areas, the Contractor may weld stiffeners as shown on the plans. Ensure that stiffeners not located at points of concentrated loads fit tightly enough to keep water out after painting, unless otherwise shown.

f. Pins

Turn pins accurately to the dimensions shown on the Shop Drawings. Ensure that pins are straight, smooth, and flawless. The pins may be forged and annealed or of cold-finished, carbon steel shafting.

683

---

Section 501 — Steel Structures

Furnish two pilot nuts and two driving nuts for each size of pin, unless otherwise specified.

# g. Pin Holes

Bore pin holes in members so they are:

- True to the specified diameter
- Smooth
- Straight
- At right angles to the axis of the members
- Parallel with each other, unless otherwise required

Produce the final surface with a finishing cut. Bore holes in built-up members after completing bolting or welding.

Ensure that pin hole diameters meet the following requirements:

| Pin Diameter               | Pin Hole Diameter                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5 in. (125 mm) or less     | Must not exceed pin diameter by more than 1/50 in. (0.50 mm) |
| Larger than 5 in. (125 mm) | Must not exceed pin diameter by more than 1/32 in. (0.75 mm) |

# h. Threads

For structural steel construction, use threads for bolts and pins that conform to the Unified Screw Threads ANSI B1.13 (Metric Screw Threads, ANSI B 1.13M), Class 2A for external threads, and Class 2B for internal threads except pin ends with a diameter of 1 3/8 in (35 mm).

# i. Unfinished and Turned Bolts

1. Bolts

Do not use ribbed bolts. Use unfinished bolts or turned bolts that conform to ASTM F 568M Class 4.6. Use bolts with single self-locking nuts or double nuts unless otherwise shown. Use turned bolts with an ANSI surface roughness rating of 125 (3.2 μm).
2. Washers

Use beveled washers when bearing faces have a slope of more than 1 to 20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis.
3. Heads and Nuts

Use hexagonal heads and nuts with standard dimensions for bolts of nominal size specified or of the next larger size. Provide a washer under the nut. Use threads with a diameter equal to the body or nominal diameter of the bolt specified. For turned bolts, threads shall be entirely outside of the holes.

# j. Anchor Bolts

Use anchor bolts of the size and shape specified on the plans.

# 9. Coating Machine-Finished Steel Surfaces

Coat the following with rust-inhibiting grease or with other approved corrosion-preventive compounds:

- Opposing surfaces of sliding bearings
- Mating convex and concave surfaces of curved plates and rocker bearing assemblies
- Sliding surfaces opposite self-lubricating bronze surfaces
- Pins and pinholes

Coat other machined surfaces with one coat of the shop primer specified on the plans. Include convex faces of rockers and sole plates at fixed bearings of spans that have line bearings on steel plates.

684

# Section 501 — Steel Structures

# 10. Shop Painting

Perform shop painting according to Section 535, especially Subsection 535.3.05.C, Paint New Steel Structures, step 5.

# E. Bolt Holes

Produce bolt holes as follows:

# 1. Full-Size Punched Holes

The Contractor may use full-size punched holes if these conditions exist:

- A member is composed of 5 or less separate thicknesses of metal, and
- The metal thickness of any one part is 3/4 in. (19 mm) or less for structural steel, or 5/8 in. (16 mm) or less for high-strength steel.

Poor hole matching will be cause for rejection. Punch holes as follows:

1. Punch holes 1/16 in. (2 mm) larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts.
2. Do not punch full-sized holes on field connections of main members.
3. Ensure that the die diameter for punched or sub punched holes does not exceed the punch diameter by more than 1/16 in. (2 mm).
4. Cut holes clean to avoid torn, ragged edges.
5. Enlarge holes by reaming.

# 2. Sub punched and Sub drilled Holes

Sub drill holes 3/16 in. (5 mm) smaller than the nominal diameter of the bolts. After assembly, ream the holes if any one of the conditions exists:

- A member is composed of more than 5 separate thicknesses of metal.
- The metal thickness of any one main part is greater than 3/4 in. (20 mm) for structural steel or 5/8 in. (16 mm) for high-strength steel.
- When required according to Subsection 501.3.05.E.1, Normal Assembly, step b.

Instead of sub punching and sub drilling, the Contractor may drill holes from the solid after assembly. However, whether drilling from the solid or sub drilling and sub punching, ensure the following:

1. Holes are no more than 1/16 in. (2 mm) larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts.
2. Holes for turned bolts are sub punched or sub drilled.
3. Holes are carefully reamed after assembly to provide a light-driving fit with the bolt.

# 3. Accuracy of Punched, Sub punched, and Sub drilled Holes

Accurately full-size punch, sub punch, or sub drill holes so that after assembly but before reaming, holes meet the following requirements:

- A cylindrical pin 1/8 in. (3 mm) smaller than the nominal diameter of the punched hole can enter perpendicular to the face of the member in at least 75 percent of the adjacent holes in the same plane without drifting.
- A pin 3/16 in. (5 mm) smaller than the nominal diameter of the hole can pass through the hole.

If either of these requirements is not met, the faulty pieces will be rejected.

---

Section 501 — Steel Structures

# 4. Reamed and Drilled Holes

Ensure that reamed and full-sized drilled holes are cylindrical, perpendicular to the member, and 1/16 in. (2 mm) larger than the nominal diameter of the bolts. Ream and drill holes as follows:

- a. Direct reamers using mechanical means when practical.
- b. Ream and drill with twist drills.
- c. Remove burrs on outside surfaces. Disassemble parts, if required, to remove burrs caused by drilling or reaming.
- d. For connecting parts that require reamed or drilled holes, do the following:
- 1) Assemble the connecting parts.
- 2) Hold them securely while reaming or drilling.
- 3) Match-mark them before disassembling.

# 5. Accuracy of Reamed and Drilled Holes

After drilling and reaming holes, ensure that at least 85 percent of the holes in any group have no offset greater than 1/32 in. (0.75 mm) between adjacent thicknesses of metal. Make sure the remaining holes are not elongated or show an offset greater than 1/16 in. (2 mm) between the adjacent thicknesses of metal.

# 6. Fitting Up

Before reaming, drilling, or bolting, ensure that the pieces forming built-up members are:

- • Straight
- • Close-fitting
- • Clean
- • True to the required dimensions
- • Free from twists, bends, open joints, burrs, and other defects resulting from faulty fabrication or workmanship
- • Well-pinned
- • Firmly drawn together

Before shop bolting material with full-size punched holes:

- a. Ensure that holes are no more than 1/16 in. (2 mm) larger than the nominal diameter of the bolt. Holes may be spear-reamed if necessary to clear and clean them for entering bolts.
- b. Carefully adjust end connection angles and similar parts to the correct position and firmly hold them in place until bolted.
- c. Fit up connections securely before placing bolts.
- d. Ream or drill unfair holes (holes that prevent the bolt from entering).

# F. High Tensile‐Strength Bolt Connections

This section covers the shop and field connections of structural joints using High Tensile-Strength bolts tightened to a specified tension. Use HTS structural bolts that meet the requirements of Subsection 852.2.03, High Tensile-Strength Bolts. Furnish the bolts, nuts, and washers according to Subsection 852.2.03.

To seat parts solidly, keep joint surfaces (including those adjacent to the bolt heads, nut, or washers) free of scale (except tight mill scale), dirt, burrs, metal spatters, and other defects. Ensure that joint contact surfaces are free of oil, grease, paint, lacquer, galvanizing, rust, and other matter. Refer to the requirements of Subsection 535.3.05.C, Paint New Steel Structures step 5.

Install fasteners with a hardened washer under the nut or bolt head, whichever is the element turned in tightening.

- • When the slope of the bolted-part surfaces contacting the bolt head and nut do not exceed 1:20 (with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis), use a flat washer.

686

---

Section 501 — Steel Structures

• When the slope of an outer face of the bolted parts exceeds 1:20, use a smooth, beveled washer.

• If necessary, clip washers on one side to a point no closer than 85 percent of the bolt diameter from the center of the washer.

When a joint assembly is complete, ensure that each bolt has a tension 5 to 10 percent above the required minimum value shown in Table A: Required Fastener Tension.

# G. High Tensile‐Strength Bolt Tightening Methods

Tighten HTS bolts with either the Calibrated Wrench Method or the Turn-of-Nut Method. For both methods, conduct the final rotation of the nut or bolt (whichever is the turned element) from a snug-tight condition according to Table B: Nut Rotation from Snug Tight.

Snug tight is the tightness achieved when the plies of the joint are in firm contact. Obtain this with a few impacts of an impact wrench or with full effort using an ordinary spud wrench. Ensure that the snug tightening procedure produces 10 to 30 percent of the required fastener tension shown in Table A: Required Fastener Tension.

# 1. Calibrated Wrench Method

Install bolts in the connection holes with a hardened washer under the turned element and bring the bolts up to snug tight (described above) as follows:

1. Snug tighten systematically from the most rigid part of the connection to the free edges as follows:
1. Start the tightening pattern at the center of the pattern near the end of each member being spliced.
2. Work toward the edges of the splice plate.
2. After the initial snug tightening, systematically tighten the bolts again as necessary using a similar tightening pattern until all bolts are simultaneously snug tight and the connection is fully compacted.
3. Following snug tightening, tighten the bolts in the connection using a calibrated wrench (either air impact or manual torque). Systematically tighten from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges.
4. After the first pass, systematically tighten the bolts again to ensure that bolts that may have relaxed from tightening adjacent bolts are tightened to the prescribed amount.
5. Operate impact wrenches until the wrench cuts out at the setting established by calibration. If using a manual torque wrench, measure the target torque with the turned element in motion.
6. During installation in the assembled steel work, verify that the wrench adjustment selected by the calibration does not rotate the nut or bolt head from snug tight more or less than that permitted in Table B: Nut Rotation from Snug Tight.

# 2. Turn-of-Nut Method

When bolts are too short to fit in the tension calibrating device, use the Turn-of-Nut Method in the actual work.

Install bolt connection holes with a hardened washer under the turned element and bring the bolts up to snug tight (described above) as follows:

1. Snug tighten the bolts using steps a and b of the Calibrated Wrench Method.
2. Following snug tightening, tighten the bolts in the connection by the applicable amount of rotation specified in Table B: Nut Rotation from Snug Tight.
3. During the tightening operation, do not rotate the part not turned by the wrench.
4. Tighten systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges as follows:
1. Start the tightening pattern at the center of the pattern near the end of each member being spliced.
2. Work toward the edges of the splice plate.

# H. Welded Construction

Ensure that welded construction conforms to the requirements below. Electroslag or electragas welding is prohibited.

687

---

Section 501 — Steel Structures

1. Insufficient Welds. Repair, remove, or replace welds that do not meet the requirements of the specifications using methods permitted by 3.7 of ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D 1.5 specifications. If the weld is unacceptable, the Engineer will reject the entire piece. After welding repairs are made, the Engineer will have the repaired areas retested to determine if the repairs meet specification requirements.

2. Unauthorized Welds. Obtain the Engineer’s approval before making temporary or permanent welds not shown on the plans or permitted by the specifications.

# I. Alterations to AASHTO Paragraphs

Ensure that welded construction conforms to the American Welding Society (AWS) Bridge Welding Code ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D 1.5 (including revisions) except as modified by these specifications and AASHTO. Exceptions to the ANSI/AASHTO/AWS specifications are noted below.

1. Paragraph 3.5.2. Instead of Paragraph 3.5.2, apply the following requirements:

- a. Before cutting ends to length, shop assemble ends of members to be field connected by welding in the laydown position (placed to grade from bearing to bearing).
- b. To align field splices vertically, match-cut adjoining ends while in the laydown position and matchmark the ends at the center point of the web section.
- c. Check rolled shapes with ends to be field welded before beginning fabrication in order to take into consideration allowed mill tolerances on web-center-line-to-flange measurements. Pair shapes to provide the best possible alignment.

2. Paragraph 3.10.1. Instead of Paragraph 3.10.1, apply the following requirements:

- a. Remove slag from welds immediately after completing each weld. Do not further clean or paint welds to be encased in concrete.
- b. For welds connecting swaybracing members to steel piling that are to be painted according to Subsection 535.3.05.E, Paint Steel H-Piling, Metal Shell Piling, and Steel Swaybracing and Subsection 535.3.05.F, Apply Special Protective Coatings to Steel Piling, Steel Swaybracing, and Concrete Piling, remove the slag and do not clean any further.
- c. Clean and paint other welds as specified below.
- d. After removing slag and after completing visual, ultrasonic, or magnetic particle inspection, either blast-clean or scrub welds with water and a stiff brush. Ensure that weld areas are clean and free of spatter, rust, loose scale, oil, and dirt.
- e. Prime welds on the same day they are cleaned, using the prime coat specified on the plans or in the Special Provisions. When using water to clean, ensure that the surface is dry before painting. Clean and prime welds as soon as practical after the weld is accepted and before the weld area rusts.

3. Paragraph 4.30.1. Instead of Paragraph 4.30.1, apply the following requirements:

- After welding studs to beams, visually inspect the studs and give a random number of them a light blow with a hammer. Strike the following with a hammer and bend them 15 degrees from the correct installation axis:
- - • Studs that do not show a full 360-degree weld fillet.
- • Studs that do not ring when given a light blow with a hammer.
- • Studs that have been repaired by welding.

In case of a defective or repaired weld, bend the stud 15 degrees in the direction that places the defective portion of the weld in the greatest tension.
- Replace studs that crack (either in the weld, base metal, or the shank) during inspection or subsequent straightening. See paragraph 4.30.4.
- On studs that must be replaced, the Contractor may manually weld the stud with the following fillet welds:



---

Section 501 — Steel Structures

| Stud Size       | Fillet Weld                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 3/4 in. (19 mm) | Full 360 degrees–1/4 in. (6 mm)  |
| 7/8 in. (22 mm) | Full 360 degrees–5/16 in. (8 mm) |
| 1 in. (25 mm)   | Full 360 degrees–5/16 in. (8 mm) |

# 501.3.05 Construction

# A. Straightening Material

The Engineer may permit straightening of plates, angles, other shapes, and built-up members if the straightening
is minor and can be accomplished in the field. Use only methods that do not injure the metal.

# 1. Heat Straightening

When the Engineer allows it, heat-straighten metal as follows:

1. Ensure that parts to be heat-straightened are free of stress and external forces. The exception is stresses
from the mechanical means used to apply the heat.
2. Carefully apply a limited amount of localized heat under supervision:
1. Heat the area to no more than 1150 °F (620 °C) as measured by temperature-indicating crayons,
liquids, or bimetal thermometers.
2. Cool the metal slowly after heating.
After the metal cools naturally to 600 °F (315 °C), the Contractor may use air-mist spray cooling.
3. After straightening a bend or knuckle, have the Engineer carefully inspect the metal surface for evidence
of fracture and for general acceptability.

# B. Erection

Proposed erection methods are subject to the Engineer’s review. Even with this review, assume responsibility for
providing adequate and safe methods and for carrying out the work according to the plans and specifications.
Begin erection only after the Engineer’s review.

# 1. Assemble Parts in the Field

Before assembly, clean surfaces that will permanently contact each other.
Assemble parts accurately, following the match marks, according to the plans and the erection diagram
shown in the Shop Drawings.
Do not hammer if it will injure or distort the members.
Ensure that fitting-up and drifting done during field assembly and connection meet the requirements of
Subsection 501.3.04.E.6, Fitting Up.

# 2. Erect Beam and Girder

Before making field connections (bolting or welding) on continuous beams or girders, adjust splice joints to
the correct elevations and slopes and properly align the beams.
The Contractor may make beam and girder splices on the ground if using the proper blocking to give
adjoining sections the correct relative slopes.

# 3. Place Anchor Bolts and Adjust Nuts

Unless otherwise shown on the plans, provide formed holes for anchor bolts. Set the bolts using an approved
non-shrinking mortar. Place anchor bolts as follows:

1. After erecting structural steel, drop the bolt into the dry hole to ensure that it fits properly.
2. Remove the bolt and fill the hole approximately two-thirds full with an approved non-shrinking mortar the
consistency of thick paint.
3. With even pressure or light hammer blows, force the bolt down until:



---

Section 501 — Steel Structures

1) Mortar rises to the top of the hole.
2) The anchor bolt nut and washer rest firmly against the metal flange, plate, shoe, or pedestal.
3) The bolt has the correct projection above the top of the concrete bearing area.
d. Remove excess mortar flushed from the hole down to the concrete bearing area.
e. Clean holes or slots and metal surfaces in order to field paint surfaces properly and to allow moving parts to expand and contract without restraint.
f. Tighten nuts on anchor bolts that pass through beam and girder flanges or through sole plates attached to flanges as follows:
1) At both fixed and expansion ends, tighten nuts and bolts to bear on the washer and then back off one full turn.
2) Draw nuts on other anchor bolts down to a tight fit.
3) Do not burr anchor bolt threads.
g. Adjust the horizontal locations of the anchor bolts relative to the midpoint of slotted holes in bottom beam flanges according to the ambient temperature at bolt placement. This allows the beam and its attached bearing components to expand or contract in the future.
h. Do not grout anchor bolts within a complete unit until beam splicing within the unit is complete.

4. Erect Steel Joints
Erect steel joints so that the surface in the finish grade plane (laterally and longitudinally) is true and free of warping.
Keep joints from moving out of their correct position during concrete placement.
Cut loose temporary connections as soon as possible to avoid restraining expansion and contraction.
Note that openings shown on the plans are based on an erection temperature of 60 °F (15 °C). Make corrections in the opening size for the actual erection temperature, and maintain the required opening.

5. Connect Pins
Furnish pilot and driving nuts at no additional cost to the Department. Drive pins so that members take full bearing. Provide pin nuts and run them up tight. Burr the threads at the face of the nut.

6. Misfits
Correct misfits by reaming, cutting, and chipping during erection.
Immediately report to the Engineer errors that occur in shop fabrication or deformations from handling and transportation that prevent assembling and fitting up parts properly. The Engineer must approve the correction method.
Assume responsibility for misfits, errors in fabrication, and damage. Make corrections or replace parts at no additional cost to the Department.

C. Finishing Bearing Areas
7. Steel on Concrete
Unless otherwise required, level and finish bearing areas with a Type IV—Floated Surface Finish according to Subsection 500.3.05.AB.5, Type IV—Floated Surface Finish.
a. Finish so that steel joint members, shoes, and bearing plates have full and uniform bearing.
b. Correct improperly finished areas by approved means.
c. Ensure that shoes and plates are on the correct alignment and elevation.
d. Unless otherwise provided, place shoes and plates on layers of canvas (cotton duck) and red primer that conforms with Subsection 870.2.01.A.1, No. 1A, Red Primer as follows:
1) Coat the bearing area surface with red primer.
2) Place three layers of at least 8 oz (227 g) duck and coat each layer’s top surface with red primer.

---


# Section 501 — Steel Structures

1. Position shoes or plates on the top layer of duck while red primer is still plastic.
2. Instead of red primer—saturated duck, the Contractor may substitute thin pads of an approved type and thickness.

# 8. Steel on Steel

Prepare bearing areas as follows:

1. Ensure that sole and bearing plates, rockers, and shoes that are designed to bear on one another fit with full bearing.
2. Keep contact areas free of dirt, grit, and other foreign matter.
3. Prepare machined surfaces that have been shop-coated according to Subsection 501.3.04.D.9, Coating Machine-Finished Steel Surfaces and that will be exposed after erection as follows:
1. Remove the shop coating.
2. Replace the coating with the same paint system used on structural steel components.

# 9. Steel on Self-Lubricating Bronze Plates

Prepare machined surfaces that have been shop-coated according to Subsection 501.3.04.D.9, Coating Machine-Finished Steel Surfaces and that will be in contact with self-lubricating bronze plates or bushings as follows:

# 10. Steel on Elastomeric Pads

Place elastomeric pads on concrete bearing areas that have the Type IV—Floated Surface Finish specified in Subsection 500.3.05. AB.5, Type IV—Floated Surface Finish, unless otherwise required. Ensure that plates that will contact elastomeric pads meet the no paint requirements of Subsection 535.3.05.C.5.e, Plates That Touch Elastomeric Pads.

# D. Field Painting

Field paint according to Section 535 using the paint system required by the plans or Special Provisions. See also Subsections 501.3.05.C.2, Steel on Steel, and 501.3.05.C.4, Steel on Elastomeric Pads.

# E. Assembly

Allow only enough drifting during assembly or field connections to bring the parts into position. Ensure that drifting does not enlarge or distort holes. Follow these requirements when shop assembling components.

# 1. Normal Assembly

Do normal shop assembly as follows:

1. Unless otherwise specified, and before reaming, assemble each individual, full-length continuous beam, tower face, bent, rigid frame, or plate girder in the shop.
2. Subpunch or subdrill and ream bolt holes in field connections and splices according to Subsection 501.3.04.E.1, Full-Size Punched Holes, and Subsection 501.3.04.E.2, Subpunched and Subdrilled Holes, while assembled in the shop.
3. Obtain approval of the assembly, including the camber, alignment, accuracy of holes, and faced joints.
4. On holes for the field connections of the ends of floor beams and stringers, do one of the following while members are assembled:

---

Section 501 — Steel Structures

# 2. Complete Assembly

When the Contract requires, make the complete shop assembly of an entire structure or a portion of it, including the floor system.

# 3. Partial Assembly

When authorized by the Engineer or Inspector, modify the shop assembly requirements above to permit partial shop assembly as follows:

- a. For plate girders, continuous beams, rigid frames, and columns of bents and towers, assemble at least three abutting sections.
- b. When the plans require that the ends of compression members be faced, assemble these members with faced ends in full bearing.

# 4. Reaming and Drilling Through Templates

Ream and drill through templates as follows:

- a. Use steel templates with hardened steel bushings in holes accurately dimensioned from the center lines of the connection (inscribed on the template) and from the finished end of the template.
- b. Use center lines to accurately locate the template from the milled or scribed ends of members.
- c. Use exact duplicate templates to ream matching members or the opposite faces of any one member.
- d. Accurately locate templates for connections on like members so that like members are duplicates and require no match-marking.
- e. Full-size ream or drill field connections through templates after locating the templates by position and angle and bolting the templates firmly in place.
- f. When using templates to ream field connections of web members of a bent, tower, or girder, do the following:
- 1) Face or scribe at least one end of each web member normal to the long axis of the member.
- 2) Accurately set the templates at both ends from the faced or scribed end.

# 5. Match-Marking

According to the erection diagram, match-mark connecting parts assembled in the shop to ream holes in field connections.

# 501.3.06 Quality Acceptance

# A. Testing and Inspection

# 1. Heat Number Testing

The Department will sample and test each heat number that structural steel is furnished from to fabricate main members. To facilitate this testing, ship one piece from each heat of main member structural steel to the fabrication site. Provide pieces long enough to take a properly oriented, representative, 4 x 12 in (100 x 300 mm) sample. This may require that the extra length pieces be 4 or 12 in. (100 or 300 mm) longer, depending on testing orientation requirements.

# 2. Fastener Assembly Testing

Upon receiving HTS fastener assemblies (bolts, nuts, and washers), notify the Inspection Services Branch of the Office of Materials and Research. The branch will verify that the Contractor has the documentation required by Subsection 852.2.03, High Tensile-Strength Bolts and sample the assemblies as necessary.

# 3. Bolted Construction Inspection

The Inspector will check the following before or during the bolting operation. Provide the Inspector easy access to the areas of the member to be inspected.

692

---

# Section 501 — Steel Structures

The Inspector will:

1. Verify that bolt tension calibrators have been calibrated within the last year. Ensure that the manual torque wrenches have been calibrated at least daily for each diameter, length, and grade as shown in this specification.
2. Ensure that bolts are routinely installed to the proper tensions. After inspection, no further evidence of proper bolt tension is necessary. If installation tension verification is necessary subsequent to installation and tightening of bolts, notify the Inspection Services of the Office of Materials and Research.
3. Monitor the surface condition and storage of bolts, nuts, and washers. See Subsection 501.2.01.A, Fasteners, for storage requirements.
4. Ensure that each bolting crew member understands the procedure for snug-tightening the joint and can demonstrate this knowledge by tightening a fastener in a bolt-tension calibrator.
5. Witness the installation method verification procedure and ensure that the same conditions exist during the job-site tightening.
6. Witness fastener installation to ensure proper tightening. This monitoring will verify that plies of connected material are drawn together and that the procedure for snug tightening is followed.
7. Witness the final tightening procedure and mark at least two bolts in each connection to verify that further tightening (from the snug tight position) produces the rotation specified in Table B: Nut Rotation from Snug Tight.

# 4. Material Application and Traceability Verification

In addition to the requirements specified in Subsection 501.3.04.C, Identifying Steel, the fabricator shall demonstrate by written procedures and by actual practice a material application and traceability method for the main stress-carrying elements of a shipping piece. The method must be visible at least through the fit-up operation.

The traceability method shall verify proper material application as it relates to the following:

- Material specification designation
- Heat number
- Material test reports for special requirements

# 5. Mill and Shop Inspection

Give two weeks’ notice to the Department’s State Materials and Research Engineer (the Materials Engineer) before beginning mill or shop work so that inspection arrangements can be made. Inspection at the mill or shop is intended to facilitate work and avoid errors and does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for imperfect material or work quality.

Do not roll or fabricate material until:

- You inform the Materials Engineer where the orders have been placed.
- The inspection is arranged or waived.

Furnish the facilities necessary for the inspection of materials and work quality in the mill and shop. Allow Inspectors free access to the necessary mill and shop locations, and cooperate with the Inspector during inspection.

Shop inspection is required for steel and other metal materials being fabricated. Inspectors will do the following:

1. Determine if steel members, member components, or other fabricated steel components meet the plans and specifications.
2. Identify the steel by color code and correlate its heat numbers obtained from certified mill test reports.

NOTE: Do not cut steel or apply prime paint until the Inspector completes this step.

---

# Section 501 — Steel Structures

# A. Quality of Work and Finish

Provide quality work and finish on shop work. Ensure that shearing, flame cutting, and chipping are neat and accurate. Neatly finish all parts of the work.

# B. Welded Construction

# 6. Inspection

An Inspector will be assigned to the fabrication shop for as much time as the State Materials and Research Engineer deems necessary. The State’s Inspector or authorized representative will inspect fabrication phases that include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Certification and transfer of heat numbers and grade steel
- Dimensions and assembly
- Inspection and testing of shop welds
- Non-destructive testing

- Perform magnetic particle testing of fillet welds according to ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D 1.5.

# 8. Qualification

Qualify shop weld procedures and welders according to ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D 1.5. The Engineer may accept tests conducted by other states as evidence of qualification. In the absence of approved shop weld procedures, welding operator and welder qualifications, qualify with the State Materials and Research Engineer as follows:

- In the presence of the Engineer’s representative, prepare test plates according to ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D 1.5.
- Requalify according to ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D 1.5 or whenever the Engineer requires. A new welding procedure qualification is not needed at the start of each new Project.

# 9. Testing

Furnish labor and equipment to do the following:

- Position welds for magnetic particle testing
- Help transport ultrasonic equipment
- Provide the Inspector easy access to testing areas

The Inspector’s access to work in the shop and field is top priority. The Department of Transportation, in its routine quality assurance inspection, will ultrasonic or magnetic-particle test approximately 25 percent of the welds.

---


# Section 501 — Steel Structures

If testing indicates faulty work, the Inspector will immediately notify the Contractor of the necessary corrective work. Ensure that welders are available to repair faulty work as soon as practical.

# a. Non-destructive Testing

If weld cracking occurs, non-destructive testing for Final Acceptance of fillet and groove welds may be delayed to:

- Within 24 hours after welding has been completed for material 2 in. (50 mm) or less
- Within 48 hours after welding has been completed for material over 2 in. (50 mm).

The fabricator may use, at its expense, nondestructive testing methods other than those specified to examine weld passes or completed welds. Refer to ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D 1.5.

# b. Ultrasonic Testing

Unless otherwise specified on the plans or in Special Provisions, test butt welds in main members by the ultrasonic method. In addition to the testing requirements of the plans, specification, and Special Provisions, the Engineer may require ultrasonic testing if the quality of the work warrants it.

# 10. Walkways for Field Testing

When field testing, provide a continuous walkway between the center-most line of stringers from one of the approach fills to the farthest row of splices as follows:

# a.

Provide crosswalks connecting with the center line walkway at each butt-welded splice or bolted connection on each row of stringers.

# b.

Rest working platforms on the top side of the bottom flange with supporting braces fitting flush against the web.

# c.

Provide at least 18 in. (450 mm) of clearance on each side of the welded splice or bolted connection. Ensure that the top of the working platform is no more than 3 in. (75 mm) above the top side of the bottom flange.

# d.

Construct walkways and working platforms of sound materials. If constructing with wood, use wood free of excessive knots or knots that could cause an unsafe condition.

# e.

Construct walkways at least 20 in. (500 mm) wide and long enough to permit each end to rest on a fixed part or member of the bridge.

# f.

Ensure that walkways have a vertical support at least every 10 ft. (3 m).

# g.

Construct working platforms at least 36 in. (900 mm) wide and long enough to permit each end to rest on a fixed part or member of the bridge.

# h.

When a deck already exists from the end bent out to the splices, do not construct a separate walkway unless the deck reinforcement steel has been put in place.

# i.

Do not allow deck forms to be placed within 18 in. (450 mm) of splices until the welds or bolted connections have been inspected and accepted.

# 11. Tolerances

For built-up members, the requirements of paragraph 3.5.1.7 of ANSI/AASHTO/AWS D 1.5, as modified, apply except at ends to be field connected by welding. The combined warpage and tilt tolerances shall be one-half that specified.

For rolled shapes, apply mill practice tolerances (ASTM A 6/A 6M) except at ends to be field connected by welding. The combined warpage and tilt tolerances shall be one-half that specified.

Use the above tolerances unless there are deviations that are additive when measured at the toe. In this case, ensure that the maximum offset between adjoining flanges does not exceed 1/4 in. (6 mm).

# Section 501 — Steel Structures

# 501.4 Measurement

Structural steel will be measured either per pound (kilogram) or per Lump Sum.

- Per pound (kilogram) basis. The quantity of structural steel to be measured for payment will be the net weight of metal in the completed and accepted structure. A unit weight of 490 lbs./ft.³ (7850 kg/m3) will be used to calculate the net weight of steel. The weights of rolled shapes or plates will be computed based on their nominal weight per foot (meter) as listed in standard handbooks such as the AISC Manual of Steel Construction.
- Lump sum basis. When the plans specify a Lump Sum basis, this work will be measured as an accepted Lump Sum quantity, complete in place. Tabulated quantities are shown on the plans as a service, but they do not relieve the Contractor of conforming to plan details. If the plan details and tabulated quantities differ, the plan details will govern. The Contractor shall determine the actual quantities required before submitting a bid.

# 501.4.01 Limits

# A. Qualification

Assume the cost of qualification tests and test sample preparation required under these specifications. This cost is considered incidental to The Work.

# B. Testing

Ultrasonic or magnetic-particle testing by the Department of Transportation under its quality assurance inspection rate of approximately 25 percent of welds will be performed at no cost to the Contractor. The Contractor shall assume the cost of additional ultrasonic or magnetic-particle testing above the 25 percent rate to determine the extent of weld defects and to check corrected work. The rate for this extra testing will be $75 per hour for the Inspector, equipment, travel, and subsistence. If the Contractor is equipped with satisfactory ultrasonic or magnetic-particle inspection equipment, the Contractor may test the Work corrected in the shop at no additional expense to the Department, but the Engineer will interpret the ultrasonic and magnetic-particle inspection.

# 501.5 Payment

This work will be paid for at the Contract Price per pound (kilogram) of structural steel or per Lump Sum, each complete in place. The Contract Price for structural steel includes the costs of labor and equipment and the direct or incidental costs of furnishing easy access for inspection and testing.

- • Neatly and accurately frame cross-bridging between stringers.
- • Securely toenail the cross bridging by driving at least two nails in each end.
2. Lay Single Plank Floors. Lay these floors using these guidelines:
- • Lay planks with the adjacent planks drawn together tightly. Lay the plank so the thickness of adjacent planks varies by no more than 1/16 in (2 mm).
- • Spike each plank to each joist or nailing strip using at least two spikes. The spike length shall be at least 3 in (75 mm) greater than the thickness of the planks.
- • Carefully grade the plank thickness.
3. Lay Laminated or Strip Floors. Lay these floors using these guidelines:
- • Dress strips to a uniform thickness of no more than 3 in. (75 mm) and to a uniform width when specified on the plans.
- • Place strips on the edge and at right angles to the roadway center line.
- • Spike each strip to the adjacent strip at 2 ft. (600 mm) intervals by staggering succeeding spike locations 8 in. (200 mm) from preceding locations. Ensure that the spike length is sufficient to pass through two strips and at least halfway into the third.
- • Toenail strips to the stringers with 20 d (4 mm) nails. Instead of toenailing, the Contractor may drive spikes vertically through the strip if they penetrate the stringer at least 3 in. (75 mm).
4. Frame and Erect Hub Guards and Railings. Accurately frame and erect hub guards, scupper blocks, joist blocks, and railings to true line and grade. Use these guidelines when erecting hub guards and railings:
- • Dress hub guards, scupper blocks, railings, and rail posts on all four sides.
- • Securely spike the scupper blocks in place.
- • Bolt the hub guards through the scupper blocks, floor planks, and, if required, through the outside joists or nailing pieces.
- • Lay hub guards in sections at least 12 ft. (3.7 m) long.

# 509.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 509.3.05 Construction

# A. Contractor Options

The Contractor may choose from these options when constructing the structure according to the Department plans:



---

Section 509 — Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning

1. Alternative Prestressing Systems

The Contractor may use post-tensioning systems other than those shown on the plans. The alternative system may use wires, bars, or strands anchored with friction grips or bearings. Unless the plans allow, do not use prestressing systems that incorporate dead-end anchorages. Choose alternative systems that can be stressed from either end unless the construction staging does not allow room to stress tendons from both ends. In this case, use anchorage systems with compression plates or fittings to seat anchor wedges.

2. Alternative Stressing or Anchorage Blocks

Stressing or anchorage blocks for the structure may deviate from those shown on the plans. Alternate stressing or anchorage blocks must be located inside the box. Place the blocks in any of the following locations:

- At the juncture of the bottom of the top slab
- At the juncture of the top of the bottom slab and the web walls
- Within fillet areas in reinforced stressing blocks
- In partial depth diaphragms

Permanent or temporary stressing blockouts are allowed in the top of the top slab when post-tensioning ducts do not have a moisture-retaining low point.

B. Install the Ducts

1. Support ducts at intervals of no more than 2 ft. (600 mm). The horizontal tolerance for longitudinal ducts in the top or bottom slab is plus or minus 1 in. (25 mm). The vertical tolerance for longitudinal ducts is plus or minus ¼ in. (6 mm).

2. Detail splices and connections in shop drawings. All splices, vents and connections are to be watertight. Pressure test ducts for leaks to ensure grout will not enter duct prior to placement of concrete.

3. Stagger splices in ducts to prevent splices in same location in a row of ducts. Stagger the splices to give a 3 ft. (900 mm) longitudinal spacing from row to row.

4. Use grout inlets, grout outlets, valves and plugs made of ASTM a 240 Type 316 stainless steel, nylon or polyolefin materials. For products made of nylon, the cell class of nylon shall be S-PA0141 (weather resistant), S-PA0231 or S-PA0401 (ultimate strength not less than 10,000 psi with UV stabilizer), according to ASTM D5989. Products made from polyolefin shall contain antioxidant(s) with a minimum Oxidation Induction Time (OIT) according to ASTM D 3895 of not less than 20 minutes.

5. Place continuous-draped longitudinal ducts in the web in one vertical row at the center of the web.

6. Tie the ducts securely to the saddles, which shall hold the duct in position during concrete placement and hardening.

7. Ensure that the clear distance between the ducts is 1-1/2 times the maximum size aggregate in the concrete mix or 1 in. (25 mm) whichever is greater.

8. Do not bundle ducts.

9. See Figure 3 below for an illustration of how to tie duct support saddles.

10. If needed, place ducts in the top or bottom slab in one of these ways:

- Horizontally at the variable spacings
- In closely and uniformly spaced groups

The minimum horizontal clear spacing between ducts must be 3 in. (75 mm).

11. Install at least one more continuity duct than needed in each web throughout the length of the structure. This duct will be used during blockage and excessive prestress losses during construction.

12. Position the ends of the additional ducts to use anchorage blocks if necessary.



---

Section 509 — Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning

1. Vent continuity ducts over each intermediate support or high point along tendon. Provide additional vents 3 to 6 ft. from high point on downslope.
2. Provide vents at the low point of every duct to drain off water in the duct.
3. Immediately before installing the prestressing steel, demonstrate to the Engineer that ducts are unobstructed and free of water and debris.
4. After installing ducts in the forms, keep the duct ends sealed to keep out water and debris.
5. After post-tensioning the steel, fill ducts with or without strands full of grout.
6. After the grout has set, remove the ends of the vents flush with the concrete surface.

FIGURE 3: PARTIAL WEB VIEW

# C. Install Reinforcing Steel

Fabricate reinforcing steel and place it according to the Plans and Shop Drawings. Do not cut and remove reinforcing steel to align stressing ducts properly. Replace bars that cannot be fabricated to clear the ducts with bars with an adequate lap length. Where bars are extended by the use of couplers, the assembled units shall have a tensile strength of not less than the manufacturer’s minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the bar.

736

---

# Section 509 — Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning

Submit revised drawings indicating the proposed bar to the Engineer for review and approval.

# D. Install Anchorages

Secure post-tensioned prestressing steel at the ends using permanent anchoring devices recommended by the prestressing steel manufacturer and meeting the requirements herein. Use anchoring devices that hold the prestressing steel at a load producing a stress of at least 95 percent of the guaranteed minimum tensile strength of the prestressing steel.

# E. Install Distribution Devices

Distribute the load from the anchoring device to the concrete using devices that conform to the following:

- The final unit compressive stress on the concrete directly underneath the plate or assembly does not exceed 3,000 psi (20 MPa) or 0.9 (f”ci), whichever is less.
- Bending stresses in the plates or assemblies induced by the pull of the prestressing steel do not exceed the yield point of the material or distort the anchorage plate as determined by the Engineer when 100 percent of the load is applied.

The Contractor may omit steel distribution plates or assemblies when furnishing large anchoring devices used with a steel grill embedded in concrete to distribute the compressive stresses to the concrete.

Install distribution devices as follows:

1. Place steel distribution plates, if used, inside the end surface of the member.
2. Recess anchoring devices so that the ends of the prestressing steel and all of the anchoring devices are embedded in concrete.
3. After post-tensioning and grouting the duct, clean foreign and loose material off the surfaces of the concrete. Do not clean the concrete until the duct grouting operations are complete.
4. Fill anchoring device recesses with an approved, non-shrink grout.
5. Cover the anchoring devices and ends of the prestressing steel with at least 2 in (50 mm) of grout, unless the plans specify more.

# F. Have the Engineer Inspect

Have the Engineer inspect and approve the placement of reinforcement, ducts, and anchorages before pouring concrete into the forms.

# G. Pour the Concrete

Pour concrete according to Section 500.

# H. Install the Tendons

Install tendons in the ducts after pouring the top deck or when the Engineer approves. Before installing the tendons, demonstrate to the Engineer that the ducts are unobstructed and free of water. Install the tendon in the duct as approved by the Engineer.

# I. Follow Weld Restrictions

The Engineer will not allow welds or welding equipment grounds on the forms or near the prestressing steel after the steel has been installed.

# J. Post-Tension the Tendons

Post-tension the tendons as follows:

1. Before post-tensioning tendons, ensure that the deck slab thickness and deck reinforcement cover comply with the Plan requirements.

---

Section 509 — Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning

2. Unless otherwise noted on the Plans or approved by the Engineer, wait to prestress cast-in-place concrete until the compressive strength of all the concrete placed reaches the required 28-day strength and the concrete is at least 14 days old. If the Engineer approves, the Contractor may apply a portion of the prestressing force to a member with a concrete strength less than the value shown on the Plans. Even with this partial prestressing, the Contractor must successfully construct the members.

3. Conduct the tensioning process so that the applied tension and the elongation can be measured.

4. Tension the prestressing steel using hydraulic jacks.

5. Tension the prestressing tendons in continuous post-tensioned members by jacking at each end of the tendon. Jacking of both ends does not need to be done simultaneously.

6. When approved by the Engineer and if shown on the Plans, tension bent cap tendons by jacking from one end only.

7. Tension the prestressing tendons in simple span post-tensioned members by jacking from one end only.

8. When tensioning from one end of the tendon only, tension half of the prestressing steel in each member from one end and the other half from the opposite end of the span unless otherwise shown on the plans.

9. Unless allowed on the plans, do not use prestressing systems that incorporate dead-end anchorages.

10. Where construction staging does not allow room to stress tendons from both sides, use anchorage systems with compression plates or fittings to seat anchor wedges.

11. Ensure that the prestressing steel force does not drop below the value shown on the Plans.

12. Ensure that the tendon force measured by gauge pressure is within 5 percent of the force calculated by elongation movement.

13. If the measured elongation at the jacking stress varies more than 5 percent from the theoretical elongation, or if the unbalanced force about the section center line exceeds 3 percent:

- a. Check the entire operation and determine the error.
- b. Correct the error to the Engineer’s satisfaction before proceeding with the work.

14. Do not allow the total force at each section to drop below the total prestressing force specified. However, the prestressing force may vary plus or minus 5 percent per tendon.

15. Unless otherwise specified on the Plans, ensure that the average working stress in the prestressing steel does not exceed 80 percent of the yield point stress of the prestressing steel.

16. To determine the amount of steel required, ensure that the maximum temporary tensile (jacking) stress in prestressing steel does not exceed 80 percent of its specified minimum ultimate tensile strength unless the Plans indicate a lower jacking stress.

17. Anchor the prestressing steel at stresses (initial stress) that will retain working forces at or higher than the minimum values shown on the Plans or approved by the Engineer. Do not allow the initial stress to exceed 70 percent of the specified minimum ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel.

18. Check that the loss of elongation from anchor set agrees with the anticipated value used in the stress calculations.

- a. Adjust measured Elongation to account for the actual measured anchor set.
- b. Maintain 5 percent agreement between the elongation and the stressing force.

19. Compute the prestress losses from friction, using the formulas in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Section 5.9.3.2.2b. The total friction losses at any section will be the sum of the effects for each tendon, depending on its anchorage location for each tendon.



---

Section 509 — Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning

20. Compute other prestress losses, using the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Sections 5.9.3.2, and 5.9.3.3.

21. After stressing and anchoring tendons and after the Engineer approves, trim projecting tendons by sawing as shown in the approved working drawings.

# K. Mix the Grout

Maximum grout temperature will not exceed 90 °F (32.2 °C). Use chilled water and/or pre-cooling of bagged material to maintain mixed grout temperature below the maximum allowed temperature.

Grouting operations are prohibited when the ambient temperature is below 40 °F (4 °C) or is 40 °F (4 °C) and falling. Remove any standing water from ducts using compressed air, if freezing temperatures are forecast.

Grout for use with prestressing concrete bridge members includes a mixture of prepackaged material and water, as follows:

- Prepackaged material—Use prepackaged material that meets the requirements of Subsection 509.2.01.D.
- The Department reserves the right to sample and test the prepackaged material before its use and at any time during the work.
- Water—Use potable water or other water that meets the requirements of Subsection 880.2.01.

Mix the prepackaged material and water in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation and as follows:

1. Mix the grout with a metered amount of water.
2. When adding water, do not exceed the manufacturer’s recommendations.
3. The materials will be mixed to produce a homogeneous grout.
4. Continuously agitate the grout until it is pumped.
5. Do not add water to increase grout flowability that has decreased because grout use is delayed.

The Engineer may determine grout pumpability according to ASTM C 939. When using this method, efflux time for the grout sample immediately after mixing will not be less than the efflux time as established in subsection 509.2.B.

# L. Prepare Ducts for Grouting

Prepare the ducts for grouting by flushing the ducts with compressed air.

1. Clear ducts of water and debris at a pressure no greater than allowed for grouting the tendon.
2. Use oil-free compressed air to blow out ducts.

# M. Grout the Duct

Bond prestressing steel to the concrete by filling the space between the duct and the tendon with grout. Grout tendons in accordance with the Grouting Operations Plan.

Grout the duct as follows:

1. Open the grout and vent openings.
2. Unless approved otherwise by the Engineer, pump grout at a rate of between 16 linear feet (5 m) and 50 linear feet (15 m) of duct per minute. Ensure that the pumping pressure at the grout inlet does not exceed 245 psi (1.7 MPa).
3. Allow grout to flow from the first vent after the inlet pipe to remove residual flushing water or entrapped air.
4. Once water or air is removed, cap or otherwise close the vent. Close the remaining vents in sequence in the same manner.
5. If the grouting pressure exceeds 245 psi (1.7 MPa) gauge, inject grout at a vent that has been or is ready to be capped.

Section 509 — Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning

a. Maintain a one-way grout flow while injecting.

b. Fit the vent used for injection with a positive shutoff.

c. If a one-way flow of grout cannot be maintained, immediately flush the grout out of the duct with water.

6. Pump grout through the duct and waste it continuously at the outlet pipe until the following happens:

- No visible slugs of water or air are ejected.
- The efflux time of the ejected grout is at least 11 seconds.

7. To ensure that the duct remains filled with grout:

- a. Close the outlet.
- b. Hold pumping pressure for an additional 1 minute and then close the inlet.
- c. Do not remove or open plugs, caps, or valves used to close off the outlet or inlet until the grout has set.

N. Place Rust Inhibitor

If prestressing and grouting are not completed within 10 consecutive days after installing steel strands in the ducts (or within 30 days in the case of bars), use rust inhibitor in the ducts. Prestressing steel installed but not grouted within the specified number of consecutive days is subject to the limits in Subsection 509.3.06.C, “Rust Limits.” If the Engineer directs, remove rejected tendons at no cost to the Department. Do not reuse prestressing steel that has been detensioned. Replace detensioned prestressing steel.

O. Paint Steel Parts

Paint steel parts exposed in the completed structure as follows:

1. Field clean the parts according to Subsection 535.3.03.A, “Clean New Steel Structures.”
2. Field paint the parts according to System IV of Section 535.
3. Paint the ends of strands according to System IV of Section 535.

# 509.3.06 Quality Acceptance

# A. For Prestressing Concrete Bridge Members

Use grout that has a minimum compressive strength of 3,000 psi (20 MPa) at 28 days, as determined by ASTM C 109.

# B. Tendon Standards

Individual wires in a 7-wire strand or wires in a parallel wire tendon may fail if the total area of wire failure is not more than 2 percent of the total cross-sectional area of tendons in any member. Failure of an entire strand will be subject to structural review.

# C. Rust Limits

Pre-stressing steel will be rejected when:

- The opened package (pak) of prestressing steel has an even coating of rust or rust film over the entire pak.
- One or more wires in a strand are rusted throughout their length.
- A length of strand or bar contains clinging rust, pits, or other faults.

Pre-stressing steel will be accepted when:

- Rust film can be removed by light rubbing, leaving light streaks or spots but no pitting.
- Rust forms during the 10 consecutive days (or 30 consecutive days for bars) between the installation of steel in the ducts and the prestressing and grouting.

Section 509 — Prestressing Concrete by Post Tensioning

D. Tendon Grouting

At least 24 hours after completion of the grouting of tendon ducts, and no more than 7 days after grouting, investigate the ducts for voids, as follows:

1. After the grout has cured, open grout injection and exit ports by drilling through the ports into the duct cavity to probe for any void.
2. Sound all grout caps for voids. Unless grout caps are determined to have voids, do not remove or drill the cap.
3. If voids are found, completely fill the void with grout by secondary grouting of the duct with vacuum grouting process that determines the size of the void and measures filling of the void.
4. If no voids are found, clean and backfill the drilled hole with Type V epoxy selected from QPL 15—Epoxy Resin Adhesives. Use an injection tube to extend to the bottom of the drilled hole.

During drilling operations use equipment that will automatically cut-off when steel is encountered.

1. Place lines of longitudinal continuous high chairs upper, directly over the lines of longitudinal slab bolsters that support the bottom mat steel. Refer to symbols “CHCU” and “SB” on the Table of Bar Support Designation Requirements (Table 1).
2. On skewed bridges where main (transverse) deck steel is not placed parallel to skew, support discontinuous ends of cutoff transverse bars using continuous high chairs (CHC) placed parallel to skew as close to the cut ends of bars as possible.
3. On bridges skewed less than 85 degrees, place an additional No. 5 (16M) bar is detailed parallel to the skew for the full deck width and as close as possible to the deck joint. Securely tie this bar to the following to maintain correct bar mat location:
- The underside of the top mat of reinforcing steel
- The forms
- The supports (beams)
- Both forms and supports (beams)
4. When using prestressed concrete deck panels, securely tie the top mat of bar reinforcing steel to each shear bar and pick-up loop in the panels. This keeps the top bar reinforcing mat in the correct vertical position.

# 6. Bridge Deck Slab Tolerances

Bridge deck slab tolerances are as follows:

1. Top and Bottom Mat. Top and bottom clearances for reinforcement steel mats shall be within 1/4 in. (6 mm) of the dimension shown on the Plans. Clearances for reinforcement steel mats shall be within 1/8 in (3mm) of dimension shown on the Plans at the time of the final screed setting check. Do not deviate horizontal spacing or end and edge clearances of the mats more than 1/2 in. (15 mm) from the spacing shown on the Plans.
2. Curb and Sidewalk Bar. Place curb and sidewalk bars within 1/2 in. (15 mm) in all directions of the Plan dimension.
3. Truss Bar. If using truss bars in the bridge deck, raise the bar to meet the top clearance specified on the Plans. Do not deviate from the bottom clearance specified on the Plans.

# 7. Bridge Deck Slab Bottom Mat Ties

Tie reinforcing steel as follows:

1. Tie the steel at each intersection of the outer edges and every third intersection within the mat unless the steel is coated with epoxy.

- In bituminous plastic cement joints, fill the annular space with joint material and wipe smooth the inside of each joint in the barrel.
- Pull box sections together with a come-a-long or mechanical puller to provide jointing satisfactory to the Engineer.
2. Multiple Line Box Culverts. These precast box culverts are the alternative to cast-in-place multiple barrel box culverts. Where multiple lines are skewed, determine the end treatment method including the positions of the connector boxes, the parapet alignment, and the lengths of wingwalls needed for proper slope intercepts. This must occur before barrel installation begins. Install multiple culvert lines adjacent to one another according to Plan details. Use grout (see Subsection 834.2.03, Mortar and Grout), a concrete mix, or other material approved by the Engineer as filler material between multiple lines.

# B. Protect Structures from Traffic and Loads

Before allowing traffic or loads on the box culvert, provide the depth and width of compacted backfill as shown on the plans to protect the structure from damage or displacement.

Section 513 — Precast Reinforced Concrete Box Culverts, Barrel Sections, and End Sections

Damaged or displaced structures subjected to construction loads or erosion during installation and backfill shall be repaired at the Contractors expense.

# C. Use Ends for Precast Barrels

Use precast or cast-in-place ends as follows:

# 1. Precast Ends

Precast ends are allowed in the following situations:

- Where either single line or multiple line precast barrels are normal to the roadway
- With skewed single lines or skewed multiple lines at locations shown on the plans or approved by the Engineer

Do not use precast ends with skewed culverts if the installation would be incompatible with roadway geometrics or would cause other detrimental effects.

# a. Precast Ends on Skewed Culverts

Where precast ends are allowed on skews, extend the barrel length so that the precast wing end on the acute side falls approximately at the same point that the cast-in-place long wing end would have fallen, with additional embankment warped to fit.

# b. Aprons for Precast Wingwalls

Use precast wingwalls with 8 in. (200 mm) thick reinforced concrete aprons for anchor connections.

For sleeve inset fill, use either expanded mortar (see Section 506) or non-shrinking mortar (used immediately after mixing) approved by the Engineer. Do not subject anchors to loads until the mortar sets up.

Use precast or cast-in-place aprons that are multi-piece or monolithic.

# 1) Precast Aprons

Carefully place sections to grade upon the screeded bedding described in Subsection 513.3.03.A, Excavation, Bedding, and Backfill.

Ensure that forms hold bedding for toewalls according to the Plan details and as directed by the Engineer.

Make joints between apron sections water tight.

# 2) Cast-in-Place Aprons

Ensure that concrete is set up before installing the wingwalls. Connect wingwalls to apron anchors according to plan details.

# 2. Cast-in-Place Ends

When required and when not using precast ends, use cast-in-place ends as follows:

# a. Use cast-in-place ends at the ends of precast box culvert barrels (either skewed or normal).

# b. Use cast-in-place ends of the same design as cast-in-place box culvert barrels.

# c. Use aprons with cast-in-place wingwalls only where specified on the Plans or Special Provisions.

# d. Use cast-in-place ends with multiple precast lines as follows:

- Minimally increase the standard parapet and toewall widths to accommodate the double inside walls.
- Use Type C connector boxes between the standard precast boxes and the cast-in-place construction.

# e. Where there is a skewed alignment or other nondescript alignment condition, the Contractor may cast-in-place a fraction of the barrel between the connector box and the parapet.

# D. Finish the Culvert

After precast sections are set in their final position, do the following:

1. Repair spalled areas around the holes.
2. Fill the lift holes with mortar or concrete.
3. Cure the concrete as directed in Subsection 500.3.05.Z, Cure Concrete.

Although square, prestressed-concrete piles are a Pay Item under Section 520, have them manufactured, finished, cured, marked, handled, stored at the plant, and shipped from the plant according to Section 865. The requirements in this Specification are minimal. Comply with the requirements and assume the responsibility for taking additional precautions to complete the work successfully.

# 520.1.01 Definitions

- Plan Driving Objective (PDO): Statement on the Plans specifying the minimum requirements during pile driving. The PDO may require a driving resistance (tonnage [kilonewtons] by formula), a minimum tip elevation, or a combination of these.
- Minimum Tip Elevation: Elevation the pile tip cannot stop above. When composite prestressed concrete piling is used, this term will refer to the protruded tip of the Steel H-Pile Section.
- Long Pile: A pile more than 50 ft. (15 m) in length.

Refer to Subsection 855, “Steel Pile” for Specifications on cast steel-H pile points. For a list of sources, see QPL 37. Use the following piling types where shown on the Plans:

- Timber piling
- Prestressed concrete piling
- Metal shell piling
- Steel H-piling

Use other piling types when the Plans and Special Provisions require it.

# 520.2.01 Delivery, Storage, and Handling

# A. Timber Piling

Handle timber piling carefully using only non-metallic slings. Do not drop or damage the piling. Store timber piles on skids above the supporting surface. Keep hardware covered.

# B. Pre-stressed Concrete Piling

Handle prestressed concrete piling carefully to prevent fracture by impact or by excessive bending stress either in storage, during transportation, or when being transferred to the leads. Do not place other materials on the piling during storage or transport.

# 1. Transporting Prestressed Concrete Piling

Transport prestressed concrete piling using the approved limits of support spacing for the various sizes and lengths of piling. These limits are shown on Standard Plans or on other drawings and are available to the Engineer from the Department.

# 2. Loading and Unloading Prestressed Concrete Piling

Load and unload piles using the embedded pick-up points placed during manufacture.

# 3. Storing Prestressed Concrete Piling

Store piles as follows:

| 788 | 788 | 788 | 788 | 788 | 788 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |



---


# Section 520 – Piling

- Store piling in single layers directly on the ground only when there is uniform, level bearing for the full pile length.
- To store piles in tiers, support the piling using blocks of uniform thicknesses placed immediately adjacent to the embedded pick-up points and in line vertically.
- Store piling in groups of the same lengths.

# 4. Placing Piles in the Leads or in Position

When picking up piles from storage and placing them in the leads or in position, use only the single pick-up point, marked with “SP” or a line painted on the pile at the plant, unless noted on the Plans or otherwise directed by the Engineer.

# 5. Driving Piles

Do not subject prestressed concrete piling to excessive tensile stresses from combining a particular hammer with the soil conditions. Excessive stress may occur, for example, in these situations:

- When encountering hard driving resistance at the point of a long pile.

When such situations damage pile, make changes to provide undamaged piling in place. If piles are damaged, the Engineer may require the following:

1. Reduce the energy delivered to the piling by reducing the stroke, changing the cushioning, or using a lighter ram.
2. Maintain equivalent energy but use a heavier or lighter ram with a different stroke.
3. Use a smaller hammer for the easier, initial driving.
4. Drill pilot holes, jet, or spud. When these driving aids are required or permitted, see Subsection 520.3.05.B, Drill Pilot Holes and Subsection 520.3.05.G, Jet and Spud.

# C. Metal Shell Piling

Do not deform or dent metal shell piling during handling and storage. Place shells to be stored for a prolonged period on enough skids to prevent ground contact and deflection. Keep the shells fully drained.

# D. Steel H-Piling

Do not deform or bend flanges on steel H-piling during handling and storage. Place steel H-piling to be stored for a prolonged period on enough skids to prevent ground contact and deflection. Keep the piling fully drained.

# 520.3 Construction Requirements

# 520.3.01 Personnel

Furnish enough labor and work to install the complete loading test, including a temporary shelter over the area if the Engineer requires it.

# 520.3.02 Equipment

# A. Hydraulic Jack for Loading Tests

If the hydraulic jack used to apply the loading test changes behavior during use, return the jack to the manufacturer, an authorized representative, or a testing laboratory approved by the Engineer for recalibration.

# B. Driving Head

Use a structural steel driving head recommended by the manufacturer as suitable for the type and size of pile being driven. The driving head shall:

- Hold the pile in the proper driving position
- Be constructed to prevent pile damage
- Be constructed to transmit the hammer energy along the pile axis
- Fit loosely enough around the pile head so that the pile can rotate slightly without binding

# C. Cushion or Shock Blocks

Replace cushion blocks as necessary to prevent pile damage. Inspect cushions periodically to ensure that they prevent pile damage.



---

Section 520 – Piling

# 1. Hammer Cushions

Use cushions or shock blocks above the driving head to avoid damaging the pile. Replace used hammer cushions reduced to half their original thickness with new cushions. Use hammer cushions of a man-made material only such as micarta or aluminum. Do not use materials such as plywood, hardwood, wire rope, and asbestos.

# 2. Pile Cushions

For prestressed concrete piling up to 24 in (600 mm), provide a suitable pile cushion block for the top of the pile. Use a cushion made of material that does not compress so far that the cushioning effect is lost. For prestressed concrete piling, 30 in (750 mm) and 36 in (900 mm) square, use an approved solid hardwood pile cushion block at least 6 in (150 mm) thick or an equivalent in the base of the hammer to cushion the hammer ram blow on the pile or follower.

# 3. Follower Cushions

When a follower is permitted or required, use an approved, square-shaped laminated cushion block between the follower and the top of the pile. Use a cushion block for a follower that is:

- At least 6 in. (150 mm) thick
- Made of 1 in. (25 mm) hardwood boards (preferably green) of uniform thicknesses
- Cut to fit the pile head

Subsection 520.3.02.F, Followers, defines a follower within the scope of these specifications.

# D. Hammers

Regardless of the requirements for hammers in these Specifications, the PDO governs in selecting the hammer. The exception for this is the tabulations for prestressed concrete piling shown in the Energy Rating Table in Subsection 520.3.02.D.1.b. Except for timber piling, drive piling with power hammers of an approved make and model (steam or diesel) that are single-acting (open end diesel) or double-acting (enclosed ram diesel). When desired, use gravity (drop) hammers to drive timber piling and, within the conditions in Subsection 520.3.02.D.2, Gravity Hammers, steel H-piling and metal shell piling.

# Hammer types and restrictions are as follows:

# 1. Power Hammers

Maintain power hammers to obtain their potential stroke length and number of blows per minute. Driving resistance values are invalid when these requirements are not met. If driving resistance values are invalid, stop the driving operations and correct the problem. Do not begin driving until the problem is resolved.

# a. Power Hammer Types

Power hammer types include:

- Steam Hammers. Use steam or compressed air from boilers or air compressors to power steam hammers. Use boilers and air compressors with an accurate pressure gauge and capacities and hose sizes at least equal to those specified by the hammer manufacturers.
- Open-End Diesel Hammers. Use open-end diesel hammers that allow measurement of the ram stroke length above the top of the hammer.
- Enclosed-Ram Diesel Hammers. Use enclosed-ram diesel hammers with a bounce chamber gauge and charts that will evaluate the equivalent energy being produced under any driving condition.

# b. Power Hammer Restrictions

Follow these power hammer restrictions:

- Timber Piling. Drive timber piling using a power hammer with a maximum energy rating of 22,400 ft.lb. (30 400 N·m).

790

---

# Section 520 – Piling

- Steel Piling. Drive steel H-piling and metal shell piling using a power hammer with an energy per blow of at least 1 ft.lb. (1.4 N·m) but not less than 9,000 ft.lb. (12 200 N·m) for each pound (kilogram) of driven weight.
- Prestressed Concrete Piling. Except as specified in the following Energy Rating Table, drive prestressed concrete piling using a power hammer with an energy per blow of at least 1 ft.lb. (1.4 N·m) for each pound (kilogram) of pile weight, but not less than 15,000 ft.lb. (20 300 N·m). Driving conditions may require hammers with more energy than the minimum required on the Energy Rating Table. However, the Department will not require hammers that have more than the minimum energy rating, regardless of pile length, unless the Plans or Special Provisions specify otherwise.

# 2. Gravity Hammers

When using a gravity hammer, regulate the drop height to avoid damaging the pile. Do not allow the drop height to exceed 10 ft. (3 m) for timber piling and 12 ft. (3.7 m) for steel piling. Ensure that the hammer is marked with its weight to the nearest 50 lbs. (25 kg). Upon the Engineer’s request, furnish a certified scale weight of the hammer.

---


# Section 520 – Piling

Follow these gravity hammer restrictions:

1. Timber Piling. Drive timber piling using a gravity hammer that weighs at least 2,000 lbs. (900 kg) but no more than 3,500 lbs. (1500 kg). However, ensure that the hammer has enough weight to obtain the PDO with a maximum fall of 10 ft. (3 m).
2. Steel Piling. If desired, substitute a gravity hammer for a power hammer when the quantity of a steel piling type shown on the Bridge Plans Summary of Quantities does not exceed 800 linear ft (245 linear meters), including test pile lengths if any, for that pile type for an individual bridge. When using a gravity hammer within the scope of the linear foot (meter) condition, ensure that it has enough weight to obtain the PDO with a maximum fall of 12 ft. (3.7 m). The maximum allowable hammer weight is 5,000 lbs. (2300 kg).
3. Pre-stressed Concrete Piling. Do not use gravity hammers to drive prestressed concrete piling.

# E. Leads

Equip pile driving rigs with leads that allow the hammer to move freely and support piling during driving. Use leads that meet the following requirements:

- The vertical axis of the leads and hammer coincide with the vertical axis of the pile.
- The leads are long and rigid enough to hold the pile in accurate alignment while it is being driven. However, ensure that the driving rig can slightly adjust the lead position to compensate for minor changes in direction while driving.

When the pile is supported by the material being penetrated or by approved templates, use hammer leads only. Driving in deep water may require special platform-type templates to ensure piling stability and position (see Subsection 520.1.03.A, Template Plan for Positioning Piling). Use templates with enough area to accommodate all persons necessary to perform and inspect the work. The Engineer may require templates in other necessary locations to ensure piling stability and position.

# F. Followers

Do not use inserts of similar type piling placed between the hammer and a pile to keep the hammer above water level or other levels. Within the scope of these Specifications, a follower is part of the driving mechanism used to drive larger-sized prestressed concrete piling. Position the follower between the pile head and the hammer driving base to evenly distribute the driving energy across the concrete area of voided-type piling. Always use followers when driving 36 in. (900 mm) prestressed concrete piling. The Department allows followers when driving 30 in. (750 mm) prestressed concrete piling.



---

Section 520 – Piling

# G. Spuds

Use spuds heavy enough to penetrate through strata or a stratum of firm or hard material to reach the necessary depth.

Control the alignment for battered spudding using templates that maintain the batter. Unless otherwise permitted, use templates to control vertical spudding.

Mark the distance from the top of the spud clearly at 2 ft. (600 mm) intervals along the length of the stem.

Use either round or square spud tips for pile driving that meet the following requirements:

- At least as large as the pile to be driven at the spudding location
- If round, no more than approximately 2 in. (50 mm) larger than the diameter or diagonal dimension of the pile
- If square, no more than approximately 2 in. (50 mm) larger than the lateral dimension or diameter of the pile

# H. Jetting Equipment

Provide enough pumping capacity, using at least two jets, to produce a volume and pressure that will freely erode the material next to the pile and the material 6 in. (150 mm) below the pile tip.

# I. Loading Test Equipment

Furnish the necessary material, tools, equipment (including a constant tension wire with a weight and sheave or a weight and round pin), and incidentals to properly install the complete loading test and a temporary shelter over the area if the Engineer requires it.

# 520.3.03 Preparation

# A. Remove Obstacles

Unless otherwise permitted, remove or cut out portions of obstacles that interfere with attaining the PDO. This will be measured and paid for as described in Subsection 520.4.01.A, Removing Obstacles.

# B. Form the Embankment at Bridge Ends

Before driving piling at bridge ends and unless otherwise shown on the plans, form the embankment as follows:

1. Make the embankment at bridge ends full depth to the subgrade template except for the stage construction providing a bench for the end bent.
2. Thoroughly compact the embankment as provided in the specifications.
3. When the Plans or Special Provisions require a waiting period, delay the construction of all or portions of the bridge as required.

The minimum acceptable length of completed full-depth embankment is specified in Subsection 101.11, Bridge.

# 520.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 520.3.05 Construction

# A. Determine the Pile Length

Use full-length piling when possible, but always use full-length timber piling. Use piling long enough to reach the PDO.

Except for test piles shown on the Plans, pile lengths are based on the lengths assumed to remain in the completed structure.

Provide fresh headings and the additional length necessary to suit the method of operation at no additional expense to the Department. Pile lengths or quantities shown on the Plans are for estimating purposes only.

The Engineer’s “Length List” will be available only after the test piles that logically cover the listed bents have been driven and evaluated and required load tests have been performed. The written “Length List” itemizes the number, type, size, and length of pile required per bent.

Section 520 – Piling

1. Steel H-Piling or Metal Shell Piling Lengths

Determine and furnish the required lengths of piling in place to reach the PDO, regardless of whether the Plans require test piles or show estimated lengths. To determine these lengths of piling in place, either drive test piles, make borings, or make other investigations at no additional expense to the Department.

2. Timber Piling Lengths

Have the Department determine the lengths of this piling. Furnish the piling either according to the Plan listing or according to the Engineer’s “Length List,” as directed. Lengths for timber piling up to 40 ft. (12 m) will be given in 1 ft. (300 mm) increments. Lengths for timber piling over 40 ft. (12 m) will be given in 2 ft. (600 mm) increments.

3. Prestressed Concrete Piling Lengths

Have the Department determine the lengths of this piling. Furnish the piling according to the Plan listing or the Engineer’s “Length List,” as directed. Lengths for prestressed concrete piling 18 in. (450 mm) square or smaller will be given in 2-1/2 ft. (750 mm) increments.

- a. Additional Lengths for Prestressed Concrete Piling. If a prestressed concrete pile, including test pile, is driven below cutoff elevation before reaching the PDO, the Engineer will determine the net additional length required and add this extension length to the written “Length List.”
- b. Composite Prestressed Concrete Piling Lengths. The composite pile length of composite prestressed concrete piling (with steel H-section tips partially embedded in and partially protruding from the concrete), is the end-to-end length of the concrete. The total length of the steel H-section and its embedded and protruding tips is as shown on the plans. The steel sections are incidental to the work.

B. Drill Pilot Holes

When pilot holes are required, drill them to the diameter and approximate depth specified on the plans. Backfill voids and holes with sand or other suitable granular material, or other material as indicated on the plans. This backfill is an incidental part of the work.

The following are not considered pilot holes:

- • Holes created by spudding (punching)
- • Holes dug to drive piling that is too long to fit leads
- • Holes dug to replace a template (if permitted)

Where pilot holes are required in granular material and the material cannot be sealed off using “mudding” drilling methods, drill the pilot hole as follows:

1. Place a casing pipe with a large enough diameter around the boring device.
2. Hold the casing in position until the pilot hole is completed and the pile driving progresses deep enough into the hard material to keep loose material out of the pilot hole.

Drilling pilot holes using casing is incidental to the work.

794

---

Section 520 – Piling

# C. Test Piling

The plans will normally require test piles only with timber and prestressed concrete piling, including composite piling. However, the Department may require steel H or metal shell test piles. When the plans show the design load of a pile as well as a PDO, the design load is shown only for information purposes if a loading test is required.

Ensure that the piling to be loaded is of the size and type and at the locations specified on the plans or designated by the Engineer. The Engineer may revise the quantity or location of the Department’s test piles. The Department may designate locations on the plans where the Engineer will record pile driving data during driving operations. Such piles are designated as “Driving Data Piles.”

Follow these requirements when driving:

- Ensure that the cross-sectional dimensions of test piles are the same as the piles that will be part of the completed structure.
- Test piles are generally longer than piles that remain in the completed structure. Regardless of the PDO, drive test piles to their full length, where possible, for exploratory purposes.
- Drive test piles of the length, type, and size designated on the plans in the locations the Engineer specifies.
- When using timber test piles, peel the piles and drive them next to the piles that will be part of the completed structure. If desired, machine-peel timber test piles and leave them untreated.
- Drive other types of test piles so that they become part of the completed structure.
- Ensure that test piles furnished and driven in permanent locations meet the requirements in Subsection 520.3.05.D.1 or 520.3.05.D.2 as appropriate, and Subsection 520.3.05.A.1. Drive test piles to determine required lengths in the Engineer’s presence.
- Cooperate with the Engineer to obtain the required data on “Driving Data Piles” as an incidental part of the work. “Driving Data Piles” do not need to be driven before other piling.

# D. Evaluate Bearing Capacity

Determine the bearing capacity of piling by determining driving resistance, performing loading tests, or doing a combination of these. Determine driving resistance for all piling driven regardless of PDO requirements.

# 1. Determine Driving Resistance for projects designed using Allowable Stress Design (ASD)

Drive a pile in one continuous operation and determine the driving resistance without delays. However, in soft material the Contractor may, at the Engineer’s discretion, determine the driving resistance after delaying driving operations. Determine the driving resistance of the piling using the appropriate formula for the hammer type. These resistance formulas apply only when:

- The hammer has a free fall.
- The head of the pile is not broomed, crushed, spalled, or excessively crimped.
- The penetration rate is reasonably uniform.

Determining driving resistance by formula is not a Pay Item. Provide the facilities for determining driving resistance by formula as an incidental part of the work.

2. Determine Driving Resistance for projects designed using Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Drive piles in one continuous operation after driving resistance has been determined and associated report has been approved by the Geotechnical Bureau. Determine the driving resistance of the piling based on the method specified in the plans, which will be one of the following methods (a – c):

1. Complete a dynamic pile testing in accordance with Special Provision Section 523. The pile bearing will be determined by computing the penetration per blow with less than ¼-inch (6-mm) rebound averaged through 12 inches (305 mm) each of penetration. When it is considered necessary by the Engineer, the average penetration per blow may be determined by averaging the penetration per blow through the last 10 to 20 blows of the hammer. In soft material the driving resistance may be determined, at the Engineer’s discretion, after delaying driving operations and performing pile re-strikes.
2. Perform a loading test in accordance with Sub-Section 520.3.05.D.3.
3. Use FHWA-modified Gates Formula as provided below (Shall not be used when driving pile to hard rock):
| Rndr = 1.75 (Ed)0.5 log10 (10Nb) - 100 | (kips) U.S units |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Rndr = 7 (Ed)0.5 log10 (10Nb) - 550    | (kN) S.I. units  |

Where:

- Rndr = nominal pile driving resistance measured during pile driving
- Ed = developed hammer energy. This is the kinetic energy in the ram at impact for a given blow. If ram velocity is not measured, it may be assumed equal to the potential energy of the ram at the height of the stroke, taken as the ram weight times the actual stroke (ft.-lb. for U.S units, kN-m for S.I. units)
- Nb = Number of hammer blows for 1.0 inch of pile permanent set (blows/in)

These resistance formulas apply only when:

# Section 520 – Piling

- The hammer has a free fall.
- The head of the pile is not broomed, crushed, spalled, or excessively crimped.
- The penetration rate is reasonably uniform.

Determining driving resistance by formula is not a Pay Item. Provide the facilities for determining driving resistance by formula as an incidental part of the work.

Once the driving resistance has been determined by one of the methods noted above, do not continue to drive piles if the Engineer determines that the piles have reached practical refusal. Practical refusal is defined as 20 blows per inch with the hammer operating at the highest setting or setting determined by the Engineer and less than ¼-in. (6-mm) rebound per blow. The Engineer will generally make this determination within 2 in. (51 mm) of driving. However, the Engineer will not approve the continuation of driving at practical refusal for more than 12 in. (305 mm). When the required pile penetration cannot be achieved by driving without exceeding practical refusal, use other penetration aids such as jetting, spudding, predrilling or other methods approved by the Engineer.

Use the Wave Equation Analysis for Piles (WEAP) program to evaluate the suitability of the proposed driving system chosen from the methods noted above (including the hammer, follower, capblock and pile cushions) as well as to estimate the driving resistance to achieve the pile bearing requirements and to evaluate pile driving stresses. Use the WEAP program to show that the hammer is capable of driving to a driving resistance equal 130 percent (1.3 times) the driving resistance shown in the plans without overstressing the piling in compression or tension and without reaching practical refusal.

Perform the WEAP analysis with personnel who are experienced in this type work and have performed this analysis on a minimum of 15 projects. Provide a list of the qualifications and experience of the personnel to perform the WEAP analysis for this project.

The Engineer may modify the scour resistance shown in the plans if the dynamic pile test is used to determine the actual soil resistance through the scour zone. Also, the Engineer may make modifications in scour resistance when the Contractor proposes drilling and/or jetting to reduce the soil resistance in the scour zone.

A minimum of two weeks prior to beginning any pile driving operations, submit to the Geotechnical Bureau for evaluation and approval the following information on all of the proposed pile driving system(s) to be used on the Project including but not limited to:

1. Items on Pile Driving Equipment Data Sheet
2. Other information on the driving system required by the Engineer
3. A WEAP program output indicating the approximate depth or elevation where the pile will achieve the bearing required
4. Valid Driving Criteria.

Valid driving criteria is defined as having the required hammer having a hammer set greater than 3 blows per inch and less than 10 blows per inch at the driving resistance for that pile.

If WEAP analyses show that the hammer(s) will overstress the pile, modify the driving system or method of operation as required to prevent overstressing the pile. Resubmit the modified pile driving system information and WEAP program output to the Geotechnical Bureau for re-evaluation. Do not begin pile driving operations until the Geotechnical Bureau has approved the qualifications of the personnel, the WEAP program output, and the pile driving system(s).

Approval of the pile driving system(s) is also based on satisfactory field trials with dynamic pile testing. Obtain approval from the Geotechnical Bureau for the pile driving system(s) based on satisfactory field performance.

If piles require different hammer sizes, the Contractor may elect to drive with more than one size hammer or with a variable energy hammer, provided that the hammer is properly sized and cushioned, will not damage the pile, and will develop the required resistance.

For penetration of weak soils by concrete piles, use thick cushions and/or reduced stroke to control tension stresses during driving.

# Section 520 – Piling

# 3. Perform Loading Test

Unless otherwise specified on the Plans, use a test method that conforms to ASTM D 1143, modified for quick load tests.

Use loading apparatus capable of the lesser value of the following:

- For concrete piles, 400 percent of the design load or 500 tons (4450 kilonewtons)
- For steel piles, 400 percent of the design load or 90 percent of the yield strength

The Engineer may increase or decrease the number of loading tests.

Furnish and read the instrumentation necessary to determine the pile settlement under load.

A loaded pile is unsatisfactory when the total settlement under Maximum Applied Load as defined by the Office of Materials and Testing Geotechnical Bureau exceeds 1 in. (25 mm) or the permanent settlement exceeds 1/4 in. (6 mm) using the standard loading procedure in ASTM D1143 Section 5.

The laboratory will determine the maximum safe design load, or the failure load of original loading materials based on the results of the loading test.

The Engineer may require the following piles to be driven further:

- Unsatisfactory piles as defined in the paragraphs above
- Piles without enough maximum safety design or failure loads as determined by the Office of Materials

# Perform the loading test as follows:

1. Test load piling as required on the Plans, or as directed by the Engineer.
2. Furnish and drive the piling to be test loaded.
3. Furnish and drive necessary anchor piling.
4. When the Engineer permits, use piling that will remain in the completed structure after load testing as anchor piles when desired.

Apply the test loads in equal increments of 10 to 15 percent of the design load.
5. Apply the loads at constant 2-1/2-minute time intervals throughout the test.
6. After the test is complete, remove the temporary materials. These temporary materials remain the Contractor’s property.
7. Remove or cut off the piling that will not remain in the completed structure.
8. Cut off the piling at least 1 ft. (300 mm) below the bottom of the footing or the ground line, whichever applies.

In deep water, have the Engineer direct how much pile to remove.

# E. Drive Piling

Drive piling to the PDO shown on the Plans. When the PDO involves only a driving resistance requirement, the Engineer will determine the depth to drive piling. If there is no Plan PDO, drive the piling as directed by the Engineer.

If the Engineer determines that driving results and loading test results require modification, drive the piling to a PDO modified by the Department.

Drive piling as follows:

1. When using pilot holes, drive the piling enough to fix the point firmly and reach the PDO.
2. Drive piling so that it conforms closely with the position and line shown on the plans.
3. Drive piling of a given type, including test piles, with the same type and size of hammer.
4. Use vibratory or other pile driving methods only when permitted by Special Provisions Plan Notes or directed by the Engineer.
5. Do not damage piling during driving. Pile damage includes:



---

Section 520 – Piling

6. Do not force piling into the proper position.

7. When driving a prestressed concrete pile, ensure that the pile point is well-seated with reasonable soil resistance before using full driving energy.

8. Determine the driving resistance when driving the pile using the appropriate Driving Resistance Formula.

# F. Excavate and Redrive

Do not drive foundation and end bent piling until excavation is nearly complete.

If driving a test pile to the side (one that will not become part of the structure) have it begin penetration at approximately the same ground elevation as if it were driven within the structure.

Redrive piles that are raised or moved while driving adjacent piling.

# G. Jet and Spud

Jetting and, unless otherwise noted in the Contract, spudding are considered incidental to the Work.

Unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer, do not jetting or spudding operations lower than 3 ft. (900 mm) above the estimated final elevation of the pile tip, or lower than 3 ft. (900 mm) above the specified Minimum Tip Elevation to obtain minimum penetration.

When jetting or spudding to drive a prestressed concrete pile, ensure that the pile point is well seated with reasonable soil resistance at the point before using full driving energy.

# 1. Jetting

When the Engineer permits, use jetting to properly position a pile. Additional driving may be required to determine the final driving resistance when piles are positioned by jetting.

Should additional driving require additional length, the additional expense involved is considered incidental to the Work.

Jetting may be required with any hammer or piling type (including test piling) and at any site. However, jet only when directed or permitted by the Engineer and as follows:

- a. Do not use jets where the Engineer determines that the jets may endanger the stability of embankments or other improvements.
- b. Perform trial jetting to determine whether to jet using one or two jets. Have the Engineer approve the trial run.
- c. Suspend the pile driving that requires jetting until the jetting is accomplished as directed by the Engineer.
- d. Jet either ahead of the actual pile driving or simultaneously with it as the Engineer determines from the results of trials. Control and dispose of water and solids that run off from the jetting.
- e. Maintain parallel drainage to railroad tracks.
- f. Do not simultaneously drive and jet a prestressed concrete pile unless there is reasonable soil resistance at the pile point.
- g. If using jets and hammers simultaneously as required or permitted by the Engineer, withdraw the jets before reaching the PDO and continue driving to fix the point of the pile firmly and reach the PDO.
- h. After jetting an area completely, recheck the driving resistance of questionable piles.

# 2. Spudding

If the plans or Engineer require spudding, do it to facilitate driving.

The Engineer may require advance jetting exploration before deciding whether or not spudding is necessary to penetrate firm or hard material.

Section 520 – Piling

# H. Cut Off, Splice, and Extend Piling

Cut off pilings at the required elevation. Splice piling driven below this elevation and extend it according to the Pile Splice Details. Ensure that the minimum splice spacing is at least 10 ft. (3 m). Lengths of cutoff of any piling, including test piles, remain the property of the Contractor. Dispose of cutoff lengths outside the highway right-of-way according to Subsection 104.07, Final Cleaning Up. If desired, use undamaged pieces of steel H and metal shell cutoff for splice plates, extensions, and reinforcement for steel H-tips.

# 1. Cut Off Prestressed Concrete Piling

Cut prestressed concrete piling using pneumatic tools, saws, or other approved methods as follows. Do not use explosives. When the Engineer considers it necessary, use an approved collar when cutting.

- a. Cut back the required amount of concrete at the end of the pile to be extended, leaving the prestressed strand exposed.
- b. Make the final cut at right angles to the pile axis.
- c. When cutting, avoid spalling or damaging the pile below the cutoff elevation.
- d. If the pile is damaged, replace the pile or repair the damage by cutting back to the extent determined by the Engineer. Replace or repair piles at no expense to the Department.

# 2. Extend Prestressed Concrete Piling

Driven extensions of prestressed concrete piling shall consist of Class AAA concrete. Undriven extensions shall consist of Class A concrete. Extend prestressed concrete piling as follows:

- a. Build, place, and brace the form work for the extension carefully to obtain true alignment and prevent leaks at the construction joint.
- b. Just before placing the new concrete, thoroughly wet the cut area and cover it with a thin coating of cement paste.
- c. When driving the extension, chamfer the top 1 in. (25 mm) at right angles to the extension axis.
- d. Remove the forms and cure and finish the concrete according to Subsection 865.2.01.B.10, Concrete Curing and Subsection 500.3.05.Z, Cure Concrete.
- e. When extending prestressed concrete piling, comply with the required details when additional driving is or is not necessary after making the extension. When additional driving is necessary, ensure that the extension reaches its 28-day compressive strength and has been water-cured for 5 curing days before resuming driving. The delay is considered incidental to the work.

# Section 520 – Piling

# 3. Splice and Extend Steel H-Piling and Metal Shell Piling

Splice and extend steel H-piling or metal shell piling before, during, or after driving according to the Pile Splice Details [Figure 1]. Ensure that the sections have identical cross sections. Instead of using the splice details for H-piles shown in the Pile Splice Details (Figure 1), when desired, use approved H-pile splicers as follows:

1. Ensure that H-pile splicers are the proper size recommended by the manufacturer for the pile to be spliced.
2. With the splicer in position and before making the splice, ensure that at least 90 percent of the mating ends of the piling to be spliced touch.
3. Connect the splicer and the piling by welding according to a procedure approved by the Department.

# 4. Cut Off and Splice Timber Piling

Accurately cut off piling to be capped with timber or precast concrete to obtain true bearing on every pile without using shims. Replace or repair piles inaccurately cut off at no additional expense to the Department. Replace or repair to the Engineer’s satisfaction. Do not splice timber piling without the Engineer’s permission.

# I. Weld Steel Piling Splices and Swaybracing Attachments

Weld steel piling splices and swaybracing attachments according to Section 501.3.06.C. Weld only in the Engineer’s presence. Use a welder with current Department certification for welds involved.

# J. Repair and Treat Timber Piling

Repair and treat timber piling as follows:

1. Field treat cuts and abrasions in treated timber piling with either of these heated treatments:
- Two applications of a mixture of 60 percent creosote oil and 40 percent roofing pitch
- Two thorough brush coats of creosote oil followed by a covering of roofing pitch

Allow each coat to dry before applying the next.
2. Before placing bolts, field treat holes made after treating with hot creosote oil.
3. Plug unused holes with treated plugs after the field treatment.
4. When the approved use of temporary forms or braces causes nail or spike holes in treated piling, fill the holes using either of these methods:
- Drive galvanized or aluminum nails or spikes flush with the surface.
- Plug the holes with treated plugs after the field treatment.
5. Field treat treated piling heads used in permanent structures that will not be encased in concrete footings or caps after cutoff:
1. Treat the sawed surfaces with either of these heated treatments:
- Three applications of a mixture of 60 percent creosote oil and 40 percent roofing pitch
- Three thorough brush coats of creosote oil followed by a covering of roofing pitch.

Allow each coat to dry before applying the next.
2. Cover each pile head with a minimum 28-gauge (0.015 in [0.38 mm] thick) metal.
- The metal may be aluminum or galvanized steel. However, aluminum is preferred.
- Trim the metal neatly.
- Bend the metal down around the pile and fasten it to the side using large-headed aluminum or galvanized roofing nails.



---


# Section 520 – Piling

# K. Bolt Timber Bracing

Bolt permanent timber bracing at its intersections with piles using standard steel bolts and nuts and cast or malleable iron ogee washers. Refer to Subsection 520.2 Materials

1. Place an ogee washer under the bolt head and under the nut.
2. Ensure that the diameters of the bolt and the drilled hole are each 3/4 in (19 mm).
3. After adjusting the nuts, burr the bolt threads.

# L. Use Prestressed Concrete Piling

Piles cracked in transportation, handling, or storage may be rejected by the Engineer as defective piles if the cracking indicates structural damage.

Piles with cracks that are not structurally damaging that will not be used in sea water or alkali soils may be accepted by the Engineer if the cracks close and are not visible when the pile is in the leads.

When using prestressed concrete piling, comply with the following:

- Do not drive prestressed concrete piles until they reach a minimum strength of 5,000 psi (35 MPa) and a minimum age of 5 days.
- Form vent holes for voided-type piles in one face of each pile at approximately 5 ft. (1.5 m) on the centers. Ensure that these holes remain open permanently.
- After completing the driving, cut back and point over cable loops used as embedded pick-up points that remain above the ground or water line.

# M. Use Metal Shell Piling

Metal shell piling consists of steel shells filled with Class A concrete after they are driven in place and cut off. Ensure that the shell’s minimum wall thickness is 1/4 in. (6 mm) unless otherwise shown on the Plans. However, furnish shells thick and rigid enough that they can be driven to the PDO without crimping, buckling, or distorting.

The Contractor may use either of the following:

- Shells of constant section
- Shells that meet the requirements of Subsection 855.2.02, Fluted Steel Shell Pile

Use metal shell piling as follows:

1. Drive metal shell piling closed-ended.
2. Unless the Plans specify another detail, construct the end closure according to Option 1 of the Closure Plate Detail [Figure 2] so that the closure plate does not project beyond the outside diameter of the pile.
3. After driving, keep the tops of shells covered until the concrete is placed.
4. Ensure that driven shells are clean and free of water immediately before placing concrete. Use a suitable light to inspect the entire length of the shell in place.
5. Before placing concrete, examine the shells for collapse or diameter reduction. Shells that are broken or are collapsed enough that bearing capacity is materially decreased will be rejected as defective piles. Fill rejected shells that cannot be removed with Class A concrete at no expense to the Department.
6. When reinforcement steel is required, rigidly assemble and lower it into the shell so that its position is correct during concrete placement.

# Section 520 – Piling

1. Ensure that there are no loose reinforcement steel bars.
2. Do not place concrete in the shells until completing driving within a 30 ft. (9 m) radius or until driving shells in any one bent or footing. If this is not possible, stop the driving within the radius limit until the concrete in the last shell filled reaches a minimum strength of 2,000 psi (14 MPa). The Engineer may adjust the 30 ft. (9 m) limit according to the prevailing vibration conditions.
3. Place concrete in the shells continuously from tip to butt. Where shells contain reinforcement steel, use tremies to pour the concrete.
4. For shells in trestle bents, mechanically vibrate the concrete starting approximately 10 ft. (3 m) below the ground and working up.
5. For shells in footings, mechanically vibrate the concrete for approximately 25 ft. (7.5 m) downward from the top of the shell pile.
6. Pour footings and trestle bent caps at least two hours after filling the last shell in the footing or trestle bent with concrete.

# N. Use Steel H-Piling

Wherever the Plans require HP 14 in. by 73 lb. (360 mm by 108 kg) steel H-piling, the Contractor may substitute HP 13 in. by 73 lb. (330 mm by 109 kg) steel H-piling and, as appropriate, 13 in. (330 mm) pile tip reinforcement for bearing pile in footings. Do not make this substitution for pile bents. Do not change the Contract Bid Price to make the substitution.

Do not cut or trim steel H-piling to fit into an improperly sized steel driving head. Instead, replace the head with one that conforms to the requirements of Subsection 520.3.02.B, Driving Head.

Place swaybracing members as shown on the Plans or as required by the Engineer and weld it according to the Swaybracing Attachment Detail [Figure 3].

# FIGURE 3

If steel H-piles are not driven in the position and to the alignment required, the Engineer may require fills and shims between the bracing and the pile flanges as an incidental part of the work.

# O. Coat and Paint Piling

Apply a special protective coating as described below to steel H-Piling, metal shell piling, steel swaybracing, and when specified, PSC piling. Clean and paint the piling according to Subsections 535.3.03.A, Clean New Steel Structures, and Subsection 535.3.05.E, Paint Steel H-Piling, Metal Shell Piling, and Steel Swaybracing.

# Section 520 – Piling

1. # Coating Requirements for End-Bent Piling

Clean end-bent piling and coat it with a System IV paint for 2 ft. (600 mm) below the bottom of the cap. As an alternate to coating, pour a concrete collar 2 ft. (600 mm) deep with a 3 in. (75 mm) cover around the pile.
2. # Coating Requirements for Structures Crossing Streams

Coat pilings as follows:
1. # Piles Not Encased

For piles within the stream and within 10 ft. (3 m) of the top of the stream bank, extend the coating required in Subsection 520.3.05.O.1, Coating Requirements for End-Bent Piling for 5 ft. (1.5 m) below the stream beds. Give piles a protective coating 5 ft. (1.5 m) below ground line for bents more than 10 ft. (3 m) outside each stream bank.
2. # Piles Encased

For piles that will be encased according to Section 547, extend the System IV paint 12 in. (300 mm) below the top of the encasement.
3. # Coating Requirements for Grade Separation Structures

For grade separation structures, extend coatings for intermediate bent piling to 5 ft. (1.5 m) below the finished ground line.

# 520.3.06 Quality Acceptance

1. # A. Reaching the PDO

The Engineer is solely responsible for determining whether the PDO has been reached satisfactorily.
2. # B. Driving Corrections

Correct driving deviations that exceed 3 in. (75 mm) from either the position or the line shown on the plans as directed by the Engineer. Do not allow the pile heave from driving nearby piling to exceed 1/4 in. (6 mm) without retapping.
3. # C. Correcting Rejected Piles

Rejected piles are:
- Unable to meet material certification
- Damaged by internal defects or by improper driving
- Driven out of proper location as described in Subsection 520.3.06.B, Driving Corrections.
- Incorrectly driven below the elevation fixed by the plans or the Engineer
- Excessively crimped in driving (steel piling)

If cracks develop in a prestressed concrete pile that do not classify the pile as defective, seal the cracks with an approved epoxy crack sealer at no expense to the Department. Place the sealer as directed by the Engineer. If a pile is driven excessively out of position or below cutoff elevation through no fault of the Contractor, correct it using the method designated by the Engineer at the Department’s expense. Correct rejected piling at no expense to the Department using one or more of the following methods approved for the pile:
1. Extract the pile and replace it with a new one.
2. Drive a second pile next to the defective pile.
3. Cut off the pile to obtain a fresh heading, splice it, and extend the pile according to Subsection 520.3.05.H, Cut Off, Splice, and Extend Piling.
4. Extend the footing or cap concrete to embed the pile properly and change the bar reinforcement steel as required.
5. Delay the Work pending a design analysis (performed by the Contractor with a Department review) and make the corrections specified by the Engineer. The delay is considered incidental to the Work.

# 520.3.07 Contractor Warranty and Maintenance

A.  Unused Piling (Prestressed Concrete or Timber)

Undriven and undamaged whole lengths of piling ordered by the Engineer will become the property of the Department. Assemble and neatly stack the lengths as directed by the Engineer at a convenient location for loading on Department vehicles. Guard the lengths against damage or loss for 10 days after notifying the Engineer in writing that the lengths are ready for loading. The 10-day period begins when the Engineer receives the notice.

# 520.4 Measurement

The items included in this work will be measured for payment as described in Subsection 520.4.01, Limits.

# 520.4.01 Limits

A.  Removing Obstacles

When the obstacle removed (see Subsection 520.3.03.A, Remove Obstacles) consists of the structure being replaced, and the Department has previously paid for removing the structure, remove or cut the obstacle at no cost to the Department. When the obstacle consists of another object below the original ground and its removal or cutting is necessary, the removal or cutting is measured as Extra Work if it is not covered by another Pay Item. Cutting by spudding is not measured for payment.

B.  Order Lengths

The Department will not recognize, accept, or pay any claim for adjusting the Contract Unit Prices because of underruns or overruns of estimated lengths or quantities of piling.

C.  Test Piling

Accepted test piles required by the Plans or the Engineer are measured per each and paid for at the Contract Unit Price. Accepted piles furnished and driven as test piles at the Contractor’s option to determine order lengths are measured and paid for the same as for other piling in place of that type used in the completed structure. Piling measured and paid for as test piles is not included in other measurement for payment. There is no additional measurement for payment for “Driving Data Piles.”

D.  Steel H-Piling and Metal Shell Piling

These piling types are measured in linear feet (meters) of piling in place remaining in the completed work and will be paid for at the respective Contract Price. Measurement does not include piling measured as test piling. Payment is full compensation for furnishing, driving, jetting, spudding, lining, filling with concrete, disposing of cutoffs, and painting, including special protective coatings. Pile encasement will be paid for by the linear foot (meter) according to Section 547.5. Steel swaybracing of steel H-piling will be measured and paid for under Subsection 501.4, Measurement and Subsection 501.5, Payment.

E.  Prestressed Concrete Piling and Timber Piling

These piling types are measured in linear feet (meters) of piling in place (plus an allowance for cutoff lengths noted in Subsection 520.4.01.F, Cutoffs) and paid for at the Contract Price. Measurement does not include piling measured as test piling. Pay lengths will be based on the Engineer’s pile order length. Payment is full compensation for furnishing, driving, jetting, spudding, lining, disposing of cutoffs, and placing special protective coatings on prestressed concrete piling, if required.



---

Section 520 – Piling

For timber piling, this payment is also full compensation for the costs of furnishing, placing, and removing temporary bracing necessary to hold the piles in alignment. The pay quantity includes prestressed concrete piling extensions (see Subsection 520.4.01.G.2, Extensions).

# F. Cutoffs

No separate payment will be made for cutting off pile or for using the cutoff lengths of steel H or metal shell piling. However, cutoff undamaged pieces of steel H or metal shell piling used to make other piles or used as extensions will be paid for as piling in place, described in Subsection 520.4.01.D, Steel H-Piling and Metal Shell Piling, Subsection 520.4.01.G, Splices and Extensions, and Subsection 520.4.01.G.2, Extensions.

# G. Splices and Extensions

All extensions and splices are measured and paid for the same way, whether or not the pile is a test pile. Splicing and extending timber piling, if allowed, will be measured and paid for as Extra Work according to Subsection 109.05, Extra Work.

# 1. Splices

For any pile including test piles, each splice per steel H or metal shell pile provided for in the Splice Tabulations will be included in the pay quantities and paid for as a Specification allowance of piling in place in the amounts of 4 linear ft. (1.2 m) for steel H-pile and 2 linear ft. (600 mm) for metal shell pile. When the original length of a Department test pile is increased by the Engineer after being driven, each splice required as ordered and accepted is measured for payment in the amount provided above. Other steel pile splices, including others made on test piles, will be performed at the Contractor’s expense. For prestressed concrete piling, each splice ordered and accepted (except those required because of Contractor negligence) will be measured and paid for as a Specification allowance of 5 linear ft. (1.5 m) of piling. This payment compensates for the costs of making the actual splice within the limits of the cut-back portion. Include uncompensated costs in the overall bid submitted.

# Splice Tabulations

| Steel H or Metal Shell Piling | In Place Length                            | Maximum Pay Splices (If Made) |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
|                               | 60 ft. (18 m) or less                      | None                          |
|                               | Above 60 ft. (18 m) through 90 ft. (27 m)  | 1                             |
|                               | Above 90 ft. (27 m) through 120 ft. (36 m) | 2                             |
|                               | Above 120 ft. (36 m) and up                | 3                             |

Splices will be paid for only when performed.

# 2. Extensions

The extension of a prestressed concrete pile, including test piles, will be the net length ordered by the Engineer measured from the original pile head to the extended head. This extension is measured as piling. The actual splice within the cutback portion is measured separately as specified in Subsection 520.4.01.G.1, Splices. Extensions required because of the Contractor’s negligence are not measured for payment. The Engineer will determine the length of extensions for the Department’s steel H or metal shell test piling. These extensions will be paid for as piling in place according to Subsection 520.4.01.D, Steel H-Piling and Metal Shell Piling.

Section 520 – Piling

# H. Alternate to Extending Test Piling

Instead of extending a prestressed concrete test pile that requires additional driving to reach the PDO (as provided in Subsection 520.4.01.G.2, Extensions.), the Engineer may give the Contractor the option of abandoning the pile as a test pile as far as measurement and payment are concerned.

If the Contractor chooses this option, the Engineer will allow the Contractor to drive a substituted, longer pile of the required length as the test pile at another location selected by the Engineer.

The Engineer will determine the net additional length required. This additional length will be paid for as piling with no splice allowance.

Complete the abandoned test pile, which is measured the same as non-test piles.

The Engineer will not allow the option if the driving data obtained is sufficient or if a loading test is needed instead of further driving.

# I. Loading Tests

The number of loading tests completed and accepted will be measured and paid for per each at the Contract Price.

Any loading test or additional stage of loading abandoned because of Contractor fault will not be measured.

# J. Cast Steel H-Pile Points

Cast steel H-Pile points of the type and size designated on the Plans are measured per each.

# K. Pilot Holes

Pilot holes drilled and accepted as a Contract Item are measured per linear foot (meter) from the natural ground (intermediate trestle bents) or from the bottom of concrete, whichever applies. Pilot holes will be paid for at the Contract Price.

Pilot holes not required by the Plans but made at the request of the Engineer will be measured and paid for as Extra Work according to Subsection 109.05, Extra Work.

# L. Composite Prestressed Concrete Piling

No separate payment will be made for furnishing and driving steel H-pile sections partially embedded in and partially protruding from prestressed concrete piling, including test piles.

# M. Unused Prestressed Concrete or Timber Piling

Unused prestressed concrete or timber piling will be paid for at invoiced cost, including transportation plus 10 percent.

1. Forces and pressures from an excavation depth of not less than 6 ft. (1.8 m) below the elevation of the bottom of the footing
2. Forces and pressures from surcharge loads from adjacent structures, roadbeds, tracks, slopes, and equipment.

Design the cofferdam to meet these conditions:

- Cofferdams shall permit placing pumping equipment outside the footing forms.
- Cofferdams shall permit driving piling between braces.
- Cofferdams shall be watertight to permit the construction of the footings, seals, or substructure.

# B. Correcting Cofferdams

Correct to the Engineer’s satisfaction cofferdams that tilt or move laterally during construction.

# C. Lowering Cofferdams

Substructure elevations shown on the Plans are approximate; therefore, the Engineer may require that both substructures and cofferdams be lowered by a specified amount.

# D. Dewatering Cofferdams

Try to dewater cofferdams without using seal concrete unless the plans require seals.

# 1. Dewatering Cofferdams Without Seal Concrete

Use all reasonable methods to provide a dewaterable enclosure, including the following:

1. Drive all sheeting within the cofferdam to a depth of at least 1 ft. (300 mm) below the bottom of the excavation.
2. Provide a double-walled cofferdam lined with clay or other reasonably impervious material.

The Engineer decides if the Contractor has used all reasonable methods to provide watertight cofferdams. If the enclosures are not dewaterable, and the Engineer decides the Contractor has not used all reasonable methods to provide watertight cofferdams, the Engineer may do either of the following:

- Require the Contractor to place Seal Concrete at the Contractor’s expense.
- Permit the Contractor to place Seal Concrete at the Contractor’s expense instead of trying further dewatering methods without a seal.

# 2. Dewatering Cofferdams with Seal Concrete

If all reasonable methods to provide a dewaterable enclosure have been used and the Engineer determines that seal concrete is necessary, place the concrete as outlined in Subsection 500.3.05.V, Place Seal Concrete. When using seal concrete, dewater the cofferdam no earlier than 24 hours after the concrete is placed unless the Engineer determines that a longer period is necessary.

# E. Removing Cofferdams

Unless otherwise specified, completely remove all cofferdam material. This material shall remain the property of the Contractor.

# 525.4 Measurement

# A. Measuring Cofferdams for Separate Payment

Cofferdams will be measured for separate payment only when set up as a Pay Item on the plans. Separate measurement will be made only for cofferdams constructed at the specific locations required on the plans, regardless of cofferdams built at other locations within the limits of the structure and regardless of site conditions.

The Contractor may request permission to enclose more than one footing in a single cofferdam at a pay measurement location. If the Engineer approves, the number of cofferdams measured for payment will equal the number of footings enclosed within that single cofferdam.

If cofferdams are not set up as a Pay Item on the plans and their use becomes necessary, they will not be measured for payment.

# B. Measuring Lowered Cofferdams for Payment

The following restrictions apply to lowered cofferdams:

1. If lowering a footing requires lowering a separately measured cofferdam, lower the cofferdam enough distance to permit construction at an elevation not to exceed 6 ft. (1.8 m) below Plan elevation at the Contractor’s expense.
2. Any lowering of a cofferdam to permit construction at an elevation more than 6 ft. (1.8 m) below plan elevation will be paid for as Extra Work.
3. The Specifications intend that no Extra Work be paid for lowering a separately measured cofferdam until the Contractor completes the cofferdam to the extent that footings or substructure can be successfully constructed at an elevation no more than 6 ft. (1.8 m) below plan elevation. No Extra Work shall be done under this Item until the requirements of Subsection 109.05, Extra Work have been met.

Section 533 — Bridge Deck Waterproofing Membrane

# 533.3.05 Construction

# A. Method A Waterproofing

Use the following guidelines when waterproofing by Method A:

1. Observe Weather Conditions
Do not perform the work when the relative humidity is above 80 percent or when rain is imminent. Prime surfaces and place membrane only when the air and concrete surface temperatures are above 50 °F (10 °C) and the surface is thoroughly dry.
2. Prime the Surface
Prime the surface as follows:

1. Ensure that the concrete decks are at least 14 days old before applying prime and membrane.
2. Prime and cure all areas that will receive membrane according to the manufacturer’s recommendation or as directed by the Engineer.
3. Place the Waterproofing Membrane
Place the waterproofing membrane as follows:

1. Unless otherwise designated on the Plans, extend the waterproofing membrane at least 6 in. (150 mm) up the faces of the curbs, parapets, and barriers in the transverse direction and to the outer limits of the approach slabs in the longitudinal direction.
2. Apply the membrane to the deck surface using either hand methods or mechanical applicators.
3. Apply the membrane to the concrete deck so that it forms a butt joint with the faces of open joints and at expansion devices and other joints.
4. Seal the edges of the membrane and the drain openings to prevent water from passing between the waterproofing and the surface it covers.
5. Install preformed sheet membrane in a shingled pattern so that water can drain to the low areas of the deck without accumulating against seams. Follow these steps to install the membrane:
1. Roll the preformed sheet membrane into place with a lawn-type roller to minimize air bubbles and to ensure that the membrane bonds with the primed surface and bonds at the overlaps.
2. Overlap each strip of preformed sheet membrane at least 4 in. (100 mm).
3. Place the membrane so that end laps are in the direction of the paving operation.
4. When the Plans indicate to place the waterproofing membrane continuously across any joint, prepare the joints as described in Section 533.3.03.B.1.
6. Eliminate air bubbles by puncturing the membrane and forcing the air out.
7. Repair these holes and other ruptures as recommended by the manufacturer. Extend patches at least 6 in. (150 mm) beyond the defect.
8. Completely open all drain holes in the deck before paving over them.
4. Place the Pavement
Place the pavement as follows:

1. Do not allow construction traffic over the waterproofing membrane before placing the surface pavement.
2. Apply the paving over the membrane.
3. Completely open drain holes in the deck after placing the pavement course.

3. Include this information on the test report and the manifest so that the waste on the manifest can be keyed to the results on the TCLP report.
4. Ensure that a chain of custody form accompanies the sample and is returned with the test results.

e. Test the samples for EPA Method 1311, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP).

f. Test one (1) sample for each bridge location.

1. If the results are 5 mg/l or greater leachable lead, the waste is to be declared hazardous and no further testing is needed until the waste has been treated. After treatment, the waste shall be re-sampled and re-tested in accordance with an approved sampling plan and shall be below 0.75 mg/l before disposal.
2. If the results are below 5mg/l, the waste is to be declared non-hazardous, then the contractor or his/her consultant shall uniformly blend twenty percent Portland cement with the spent material and solidify the mixture before disposing of it at a licensed solid waste landfill.

g. Additional samples must be acquired according to EPA SW 846 and SSPC-Guide 7 Section 5.6.5.

h. Mail the Test reports and manifests to the Engineer's office, which will review them, take the appropriate action and send them to the lab files at the Office of Materials and Research. Send an extra copy of each to the Office of Materials and Research/Independent Assurance.

If the TCLP toxicity test results classify the spent materials as a hazardous waste, treat the waste either on-site or off-site to the Land Disposal Restriction Standard of 0.75 mg/l. Do not dispose of the waste until authorized by the Engineer. Hazardous waste material may be treated off-site if the treatment is performed by a licensed hazardous waste treatment facility in accordance with EPA and EPD guidelines.

Forward a copy of all manifests and other pertinent documents to the Engineer and to OMR. These documents will be maintained in the project file for three years.

If after treatment, the spent material is classified as a hazardous waste by the TCLP test, retreat it until the Universal Treatment Standard is met. Hazardous waste disposal shall be paid for as specified under Subsection 535.5 Payment, of this specification.

# 10. Handle hazardous waste as follows:

1. Comply with Section 107 of the specifications. The Contractor is responsible for complying with the hazardous waste laws when performing the Work.

# B. Meet General Painting Requirements

Follow these requirements when painting new and existing steel structures:

# 1. Weather Conditions

Cleaning or Painting shall not take place during windy or gusty conditions unless the contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Engineer that containment is sufficient to prevent the escape of paint overspray or spent material. If any paint overspray or spent material is detected outside containment areas, cease all operations until cleanup has been completed. Do not recommence cleaning or painting operations until additional measures have been taken to prevent any future escape of spent material and/or paint overspray.

When the Plans specify System VI (waterborne), ensure that the minimum air and surface temperature is 50 °F (10 °C). Comply with the other weather requirements listed below.

When the Plans specify System VII, ensure that the minimum air and surface temperatures are above 35 °F (2 °C) and the relative humidity is greater than 50% when applying the inorganic zinc primer. Apply System VII waterborne intermediate and top coats only when the temperatures of both the air and surface are above 50 °F (10 °C).

For Systems IV and V (alkyd), apply paint only when the air and surface temperatures are both above 40 °F (4 °C).

| Weather Requirements for Painting All Systems |                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Maximum surface temperature                   | 140 °F (60 °C)              |
| Relative humidity                             | Below 85%                   |
| Minimum surface temperature                   | 5 °F (3 °C) above dew point |

Follow these weather restrictions:

- Do not apply paint to surfaces that are damp or otherwise unsatisfactory as determined by the Engineer.
- Do not paint in open yards or on erected structures when the metal is hot enough to cause the paint to blister or produce a porous film.
- Do not paint metal hot enough to cause oil separation in the alkyd paint.
- Do not paint metal when freezing weather 32 °F (0 °C) is forecast or expected before the paint can dry.
- Do not store at temperatures below 32 °F (0 °C) or above 100 °F (38 °C). When outdoor temperatures exceed these limits, paint shall be stored in an appropriate indoor location.

# 2. Oxidation

If a prime coat on structural steel fades or chalks because of oxidation, thoroughly remove the oxidation by brushing or by washing with water until the sound prime coat is visible.

# 3. Paint Thinning

Do not thin or dilute paints.

# 4. Application Methods

Thoroughly mix paints in their shipping containers using mechanical devices before removing the paint. For inorganic zinc primers, add the powder component to the liquid component with thorough stirring, and continue stirring until the powder is well dispersed. Strain the mixture through a 30-60 mesh sieve to remove large particles. Use pressure pots equipped with a mechanical agitator, which will remain in motion throughout the application.

Ensure that the paint formulation matches the application method (brush, roller, airless spray, or air spray). Apply paint neatly by brushing, spraying, or rolling. Use rollers only as specified in Subsection 535.3.02.C, Rollers. When using brushes or rollers, apply the paint as follows:

- a. Produce an even coating covering the metal or the previous coat.
- b. Work the paint into corners and crevices.

Section 535 — Painting Structures

Paint new steel structures as follows:

1. Use the correct paint system. The Plans usually specify one of the systems shown in the Table of Paint Systems and Minimum Required Dry Film Thickness. If the Plans do not specify a paint system, use System VI. If the structure is located in the 13-county ozone non-attainment region, use only Waterborne coatings for any painting operation conducted between May 1 and September 30. The 13 metro Atlanta counties that comprise the non-attainment region are: Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Paulding, and Rockdale.

# 5. Specials (Wyes, Tees, and Bends)

Install wyes, tees, and bends as shown on the Plans or as directed.

# 6. Tapered Pipe Inlets

Locate and install tapered pipe inlet end sections as shown on the Plans or as directed.

# 7. Elongation

Elongate metal pipe as shown on the Plans. Order the elongation of the vertical axis of the pipe to be done in the shop. Ensure the manufacturer ships metal pipe with wire ties in the pipe ends. Remove wire-ties immediately after completing the fill.

# 8. Flared End Sections

Use flared end sections on the inlet, outlet, or on both ends of storm drain pipe, according to Plan details.

# 550.3.06 Quality Acceptance

The Engineer will visually inspect all pipe for alignment, deflection, cracking, joint separation, sagging, or other exterior damage.

The Department may elect to conduct Quality Assurance verifications of any pipe inspections. These verifications will be performed by Department personnel.

The Department will require video inspection on projects that have more than 500 linear feet of storm drain pipe and on routes with an AADT greater than 3,000 vehicles. Conduct video inspection in accordance with the requirements of this Specification and GDT 136 on 20% of all storm drain pipe and 10% of all side drain pipe installations. The Engineer will randomly select installations to be tested.

Unless the Engineer directs otherwise, schedule the video inspections for the selected locations no sooner than 30 days after completing pipe installations to be tested.

# A. Post Installation Inspection

Before post installation inspection, dewater installed pipe (if necessary) and provide the Engineer with a post installation inspection schedule. Notify the Engineer at least seven days in advance of beginning inspection. Perform post installation inspections once compacted backfill has reached a depth of 8 feet or after completion of the pipe installation and final cover, which includes the embankment and all non-asphalt bases and/or subgrades. Notify the Engineer if distresses or locations of improper installation are discovered. When camera testing shows distresses or improper installation in the installed pipe, the Engineer may require additional sections to be tested or may require corrective action.

Video and laser profiling and measurement technology must be certified by the company performing the work to meet the requirements of GDT 136. Inspection contractor personnel completing remote inspections shall be NASSCO – PACP Certified Technicians. Testing performed by a company failing to meet these requirements will result in non-payment of the pipeline video inspection and non-certification of the pipe tested.

For video recorded, laser profiled pipe indicating deflection is in excess of Specification requirements, the Contractor may elect to further test the pipe with the use of a mandrel. Ensure mandrel meets requirements of GDT 136 and the Engineer has approved before use. Mandrel or manual post installation inspection allowed for pipe diameters greater than 48 inches.

Section 551 — Pile Protection in Earth Walls

# A. Method A

After driving the end bent piles and before installing the earth reinforcing elements:

1. Place a cylindrical can over each pile to prevent the earth wall backfill material from contacting the pile. Use a can large enough in diameter to give a 1 in. (25 mm) minimum clearance from the pile to the inside of the can.
2. Place a spacer between the pile and the can to prevent the can from contacting the pile during wall backfilling. Extend the cans from the bottom of the earth-stabilized backfill to the bottom of the bridge end bent cap.
3. After positioning the cans, seal them at the top while backfilling to keep rubbish or aggregate out of the can. Keep the cans sealed until fill settlement time has expired.
4. When the wall backfill has reached the bottom of the cap and fill settlement time has expired, fill the cans with aggregate.

# B. Method B

Cover the piles with the following amounts of corrosion-inhibiting grease as follows:

- Steel piling = 1/16 in. (2 mm) minimum
- Concrete piling = 1/4 in. (6 mm) minimum

1. Apply grease only after driving the piles. Treat only the pile portion that will be in contact with the wall backfill.
2. In addition to the grease, install a urethane or polypropylene sleeve to protect the grease coating from the backfill.
3. Use spray-on or preformed sleeves. Replace portions of the sleeve damaged or removed by construction activities during backfill.

Use hot-dipped galvanized, bituminous-coated steel of the size, thickness, and sectional modulus specified. Use plates made of hot-rolled, cold-formed steel that conform to ASTM A 569/A 569 M. Use plates with the following mechanical properties before cold forming:

- Tensile strength = 42,000 psi (290 MPa)
- Yield strength = 28,000 psi (190 MPa)
- Elongation, 2 in. (50 mm) = 30 percent

# 2. Grout Intrusion Nipples

Provide grout intrusion nipples 2 in. (50 mm) or larger in diameter in the top plates at intervals 10 ft (3 m) or less. This will permit grouting while the tunnel liner is erected. For larger tunnels, or where conditions make more grout openings advisable, install additional plates with nipples at the top quarter points and/or on each side between the top openings. Stagger these additional openings but keep the distance between them 10 ft. (3 m) or less in any one line.

# 3. Flanged Joints

Form plates to provide circumferential flanged joints. Use longitudinal joints that are flanged or offset lap seam type. Punch plates for bolting on both longitudinal and circumferential seams or joints. Space bolts in circumferential flanges according to the manufacturer’s standard spacing. Space bolts a multiple of the plate length so that plates with the same curvature are interchangeable and will permit staggering of longitudinal seams.

# 4. Longitudinal Seams

For lapped longitudinal seams, ensure that bolt size and spacing is according to the manufacturer’s standard, but meets the longitudinal seam strength requirements of Section 12 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. Galvanizing Bituminous Coating and Bolts shall be in compliance with applicable information in Section 844.

Section 555 — Tunnel Liner

A. Installation of Liner Plates

Use the same type of liner plates for the full length of the tunnel. Flanged and lapped seam methods of construction are acceptable.

1. General
Install self-supporting steel liner plates according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Do not leave more than 5 ft. (1.5 m) of tunnel unlined while tunneling. Do not leave more than 1 ft. (300 mm) of tunnel unlined at the end of the day’s operation.
2. Sealing
Before grouting tunnel liner segments, seal that segment sufficiently between the liner plates and the surrounding soil to retain the grouting pressure. Place the seals in these locations:

- At the tunnel entrance
- Between grout intrusion nipples
- Within 1 ft. (300 mm) of the end of the tunnel
3. Pressure Grouting
Pressure grout voids in the area outside the plates every 10 ft. (3 m) at the end of the work shift. Grout more frequently if soil conditions dictate.
4. Repair
Repair damaged spelter coating according to Section 645. Replace plates with damaged spelter or bituminous coatings at no additional cost to the Department if the Engineer determines they cannot be repaired.

B. Safety

Schedule the Work to avoid interfering with or endangering traffic flow on the highway or railway. Follow required safety measures specified in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

1. Begin tunneling at one end of a pit that has been sheeted and shored as necessary. Comply with Section 615. Perform work below the level of the roadbed.
2. Complete tunneling at one location before beginning work at another.
3. If the Engineer determines that tunneling is endangering overpassing roadway or the traveling public, stop tunneling until making the necessary corrections.
4. Provide a well-braced, temporary bulkhead against the face of the excavation when work stops while the heading is within 20 ft. (6 m) of railroad tracks or highway pavement.
5. If distress occurs to roadway due to tunneling, the Contractor shall submit for approval a plan to repair the roadway.

C. Portals

Close tunnel portals at each end using a three-course mortared brick wall according to Plan details. Erect one of the three courses inside the liner.

# A. Excavation

Excavate in accordance with the details and elevations shown on the Plans or to an additional depth as directed by the Engineer to intercept the water-bearing strata encountered during construction. Begin the excavations with the topmost bench and proceed to the bottom of the slope. Excavate as necessary to provide continuous slope underdrain coverage from the top of the water-bearing strata to the bottom of the slope. When encountering unstable conditions in the bottom of the excavation, remove unstable material as directed by the Engineer and replace with approved granular material and compact so as to provide a stable foundation for the excavation and placement of pipes.

# B. Placement of Geocomposite Wall Drains

Place the Geocomposite wall drains the full height and width of the vertical bench cuts and secure the drains with metal staples or wooden stakes. Do not allow any horizontal joints or splices to remain in the drains. Abut adjoining drain strips to make vertical joints between drain strips.

# C. Placement of Plastic Filter Fabric

Place plastic filter fabric of sufficient length to cover the drainage aggregate at the bottom of the bench excavation adjacent to the geocomposite wall drain. Overlap the fabric with a minimum of 3 feet (914 mm) of material. Sewing of the fabric will not be required. The fabric may be cut at the locations of the solid underdrain pipe to allow for wrapping around the drainage aggregate.

# D. Placement of Pipe and Aggregate

Place perforated pipe continuous with the bench excavation adjacent to the Geocomposite wall drain in accordance with the details shown on the Plans. Place solid pipe at 200-foot (61-meter) intervals with a minimum of 2 solid pipes at each bench excavation, joined to perforated pipe with “T” connections. Connect all joints securely. Place drainage aggregate to a level of 6 inches (152 mm) above the pipes without disturbing the pipe alignment. Wrap the plastic filter fabric over the drainage aggregate prior to backfilling with soil.

# E. Backfilling and Placement of Geogrid Reinforcement

Place soil to be used as backfill material with the same lift and compaction requirements as normal embankment construction. Do not disturb the pipe alignment. Place layers of Type B geogrid reinforcement 4 feet (1.22 m) long beginning at a level 2 feet (600 mm) above the bottom of each bench, and at 1-foot (300 mm) intervals thereafter as each bench excavation is backfilled.

# F. Markers

Mark each outlet end of the drainage pipe in accordance with Plan details.

# Section 572 — Slope Underdrains

# G. Protection from Contamination

Protect all materials from contamination by foreign matter. In the event that the drainage aggregates, plastic filter fabric or Geocomposite wall drains become contaminated, remove the contaminated portion and replace with clean material at no additional cost to the Department. Placement of soil backfill over the fabric is incidental to the Work and is not considered to be contamination.

# H. Type B Concrete Flume

After the slope is backfilled, construct a Type B concrete flume at each solid drain location as indicated on the Plans. Extend each flume from the topmost solid drain pipe to the bottom of the slope.

# 572.4 Measurement

Slope underdrains will be measured for payment by the linear foot (meter) of accepted perforated underdrain in place at each bench excavation. No separate measurement will be made for bench excavation, drainage aggregate, Geocomposite wall drain, solid drain pipe, connections, geogrid, plastic filter fabric, or backfill required by the Plan Details. Additional depth bench excavation required beyond the limits of the Plan details and directed by the Engineer will be measured according to Subsection 205.4 of the Specifications.

1. Insert the anchor bolts to the prescribed depth.
2. Place additional mortar as required in the annular space around the anchor bolts until the mortar is well packed and flush with the top surface of the concrete.
3. Wipe clean the exposed surfaces of the anchor bolts and substructure. Do not allow a load on mortar that has not been in place at least 7 days.
3. Install Masonry Plates

Set the masonry plates to the proper elevation on the previously finished concrete pads.
4. Install the Bearings

1. Place the bearing at the predetermined locations when erecting the superstructure.
2. Remove the temporary restraints as directed by the bearing manufacturer.
3. Adjust the bearings as follows:
- Adjust the expansion bearings from the normal position at 60 °F (15 °C) to allow for the ambient temperature during erection or casting.
- Adjust the pot bearings to allow them to move when dead loads are applied. Ensure that the bearing is properly positioned and parallel (free from rotation) after applying the dead load.
- Adjust the bearings horizontally on the masonry plate to properly fit the superstructure members being erected.
4. After adjustments and approval by the Engineer, weld the bearings to the masonry plate.

# 581.3.06 Quality Acceptance

# Section 603 — Rip Rap

# A. Preparing the Foundations

Prepare the ground surface where the rip rap will be placed to conform with the correct lines and grades before beginning the placement.

1. When filling depressions, compact the new material with hand or mechanical tampers. Dispose of excess material by spreading it neatly within the right-of-way as an incidental part of the work.
2. Unless otherwise shown or provided below, begin placing the rip rap in a toe ditch constructed in original ground around the toe of the fill or the cut slope. Ensure that the toe ditch is 2 ft. (600 mm) deep in original ground and the side next to the fill or cut has the same slope.
3. After placing the rip rap, backfill the toe ditch and spread the excess dirt neatly within the right-of-way as an incidental part of the work.
4. When beginning rip rap in water or below normal water level, substitute an apron of rip rap for the toe ditch. Ensure that the width and thickness of this apron is as shown on the plans or determined by the Engineer.

# B. Placing Stone Rip Rap

Place rip rap to the limits shown on the Plans or as directed by the Engineer. Place and classify rip rap as follows:

1. Stone Plain Rip Rap
Dump and handle stone plain rip rap into place to form a compact layer to the design thickness. Ensure that the thickness tolerance for the course is plus 12 in. (300 mm) with no under-tolerance. If the plans do not show a thickness, place stone rip rap to at least 12 in. (300 mm) thick, but no greater than 2 ft. (600 mm) thick.
2. Stone Dumped Rip Rap
Dump stone dumped rip rap into place to form a uniform surface as thick as specified in the Plans.

1. Ensure that the thickness tolerance for the course is minus 6 in. (150 mm) and plus 12 in. (300 mm). If the plans or proposal do not specify a thickness, place the course to at least 2 ft. (600 mm) thick.
2. Recycled concrete that meets the requirements of Subsection 805.2.01 may be used instead of stone when shown on the plans or approved by the Engineer. Use recycled concrete only when materials do not contain steel after processing.
3. Stone Grouted Rip Rap
Place stone grouted rip rap according to specifications for stone plain rip rap and these guidelines:

1. Prevent earth from filling the spaces between the stones.
2. After placing the stone, fill the spaces between them with 1:3 grout composed of Portland cement and sand mixed thoroughly with enough water to make a thick, creamy consistency.
3. Place the grout beginning at the toe. Finish it by sweeping with a stiff bristle broom.
4. After grouting, cover the rip rap and keep it wet for 5 days, or cover and keep wet for 24 hours and then coat with white pigmented membrane curing compound.



---

Section 603 — Rip Rap

C. Placing Filter

Place woven plastic filter fabric under all rip rap. Follow these requirements for placing the filter fabric:

1. Prepare the surface to receive the fabric until it is smooth and free from obstructions, depressions, and debris.
2. Place the fabric with the long dimension running up the slope. Minimize the number of overlaps.
3. Place the strips to provide a width of at least 1 ft. (300 mm) of overlap for each joint.
4. Anchor the filter fabric in place with securing pins of the type recommended by the fabric manufacturer. Place the pins on or within 3 in. (75 mm) of the centerline of the overlap.
5. Place the fabric so that the upstream strip will overlap the downstream strip.
6. Loosely place the fabric to prevent stretching and tearing during stone placement. Do not drop the stones more than 3 ft. (1 m) during construction.
7. Always protect the fabric during construction from clogging due to clay, silts, chemicals, or other contaminants.
8. Remove contaminated fabric or fabric damaged during installation or rip rap placement. Replace with uncontaminated or undamaged fabric at no expense to the Department.

D. Placing Sand-Cement Bag Rip Rap

Place rip rap to the limits shown on the plans or as directed by the Engineer.

1. Proportioning Materials
1. Mix sand and Portland cement at the maximum ratio of 5:1 by weight.
2. Obtain a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi (3 MPa) in 7 days.
3. For sand-cement bag rip rap, use enough water to make up the optimum moisture content of the aggregate and cement as determined by AASHTO T 134.
4. When sand-cement rip rap is to be prebagged, mix the sand cement dry. After placing each course, wet the bags until the bags are wet enough for proper cement hydration.
2. Placement
1. Before placing sand-cement bag rip rap, fill the bags full, but allow room to tie the bags.
2. Place the bagged rip rap by hand with the tied ends facing the same direction. Produce close, broken joints.
3. Place header courses when directed by the Engineer or required by the plans.
4. After placing the bags, ram or pack them against one another to produce the required thickness and form a consolidated mass.
5. Do not allow the top of each bag to vary more than 3 in. (75 mm) above or below the required plane.

E. Placing Stone Blanket Protection

Ensure that the stone blanket protection meets the materials Specifications for stone filter blanket as specified in Subsection 603.2, Materials, except stone size No. 357 will be allowed instead of size No. 467.

Place stone blanket protection to the limits shown on the plans, or as directed by the Engineer. Uniformly place this material to the thickness shown on the plans and to a thickness tolerance of 0.5 in. (± 15 mm).

Do not use stone blanket protection on slopes steeper than two horizontal to one vertical or in areas highly susceptible to erosion. Do not use plastic filter fabrics with stone blanket protection.

Section 607 — Rubble Masonry

# 607.3.05 Construction

Construct rubble masonry as follows:

# A. Shaping the Stone

Roughly square the stones on joints, beds, and faces. At angles and ends of walls, use selected stone roughly squared and pitched to line. If specified, finish the corners or angles in exterior surfaces with a chisel draft. Before laying the stone in the wall, shape and dress it so that it will not loosen after it is placed. No dressing or hammering which will loosen the stone will be permitted after it is placed.

# B. Laying the Stone

1. Decrease the stone thickness from the bottom to the top of wall.
2. Ensure that the headers in the heart of the wall are the same size as shown in the face and extend at least 12 in. (300 mm) into the core or backing.
3. Ensure that headers in walls 2 ft. (600 mm) or less in thickness extend entirely through the wall. The headers shall occupy at least 20 percent of the face of the wall.
4. Lay the masonry to line and in roughly leveled courses. Ensure that the bottom of the foundation is large, selected stones.
5. Lay the courses with leaning beds parallel to the natural bed of the material.
6. Regularly diminish the thicknesses of the courses, if varied, from the bottom to the top of the wall. Keep a surplus supply of stones at the site to select from.
7. When mortar masonry is specified:
1. Clean each stone and saturate it with water before setting it. Clean and moisten the bed that will receive it.
2. Bed the stones in freshly made mortar with full joints. Carefully settle the stones in place before the mortar sets.
3. Do not permit spalls in the beds. Ensure that the joints and beds have an average thickness of not more than 1 in. (25 mm).
4. Ensure that the vertical joints in each course break with the adjoining courses at least 6 in. (150 mm).
5. Do not place vertical joints directly above or below a header joint.
6. If a stone is moved or if the joint is broken after the mortar has set, take the stone up and thoroughly clean the mortar from the bed and joints. Reset the stone in fresh mortar. Do not lay the masonry in freezing weather or when the stone contains frost, except by permission and subject to required conditions.
7. NOTE: Do not lay the masonry in freezing weather or when the stone contains frost, except with permission.
8. Whenever possible, properly point the face joints before the mortar sets. If joints cannot be pointed, rake them out to a depth of 1 in. (25 mm) before the mortar sets. Do not smear the stone face surfaces with the mortar forced out of the joints or the mortar used in pointing.
9. Thoroughly wet the joints pointed after the stone is laid with clean water and fill with mortar.
10. Drive the mortar into the joints and finish with an approved pointing tool.
11. Keep the wall wet while pointing. In hot or dry weather, protect the pointed masonry from the sun and keep it wet for at least three days after the pointing is finished.
12. NOTE: Do not perform pointing in freezing weather or when the stone contains frost.

# Section 607 — Rubble Masonry

j. After the pointing is completed and the mortar is set, thoroughly clean the walls and leave them in a neat condition.

# 8. Dry Rubble Masonry

When laying dry rubble:

- a. Take care that each stone takes a firm bearing no less than in three separate points upon the underlying course.
- b. Ensure that face joints are no greater than 1 in. (25 mm) wide.
- c. Chink the open front and rear joints with spalls fitted to take firm bearing upon the top and bottom surfaces throughout the length of the stone.
- d. Fill the interstices in the heart of the wall with spalls. When specified, thoroughly slush the open joint on the rear surfaces with mortar to prevent water from seeping through the joints.

# C. Weep Holes

Provide adequate drainage for retaining walls with weep holes as shown on the plans or required by the Engineer. When backfilling at weep holes, build chimneys and French drains extending through the parts of the fill to be drained. The cost of chimneys, weep holes, and French drains is included in the Contract Price for rubble masonry.

# D. Copings

Use copings, bridge seats, and back walls made from the materials shown on the Plans. If not otherwise specified, they shall be Class A concrete. Make concrete copings in sections at least 12 in. (300 mm) thick and from 5 to 10 ft. (1.5 to 3 m) long, extending the full width of the wall. Cast the sections in place or precast and set them in place in free mortar beds.

Dispose of the excavated material from the following jacking or boring operations or use it as directed by the Engineer at no additional cost to the Department.

# A. Jacking

Follow these requirements when jacking:

1. Excavate suitable pits or trenches for the jacking operation and for placing the end joints of pipe, when required. Securely sheet and brace the pits or trenches to prevent caving, where necessary.
2. When installing pipe under railroads, highways, streets, or other facilities by jacking or boring, perform construction and prevent:
- Interfering with the facility operation
- Weakening the roadbed or structure
3. To force the pipe through the roadbed, use a jack with a head constructed to apply uniform pressure around the ring of the pipe.
4. Set the pipe to be jacked on guides, braced together to properly support the pipe section and to direct it to the proper line and grade.
5. Excavate the roadbed as follows:
1. Excavate roadbed material just ahead of the pipe.
2. Remove the excavated material through the pipe.
3. Ensure that the excavation diameter conforms to the outside diameter and circumference of the pipe as closely as possible.
6. Force the pipe through the roadbed into the excavated space.
7. Use an approved mix to pressure grout voids that develop during installation and that the Engineer determines are detrimental to the work.
8. Ensure that the excavation does not extend beyond the pipe more than 2 ft. (600 mm). Decrease the distance at the Engineer’s direction or if the character of the excavated material allows.
9. Jack the pipe from the low or downstream end. The line and grade from the pipe’s final position established by the Engineer may vary no more than two percent in lateral alignment and one percent in vertical grade. Ensure that the final grade of the flow line is in the direction indicated on the plans.
10. Use a cutting edge around the head end. Extend it a short distance beyond the pipe end with inside angles or lugs to keep the cutting edge from slipping back into the pipe.
11. Once the pipe jacking has begun, proceed with the operation without interruption to prevent the pipe from becoming firmly set in the embankment.

Design pressure diagram shall include the effect of surcharge loading

NOTE: The above diagrams apply for cohesionless soils. For cohesive soils the effect of cohesion may be considered.

Where lagging is in place, active earth pressure acts over the entire wall surface. Below lagging, active earth pressure acts only on the soldier pile width and passive earth pressure is generated as follows:

- A) In sands and saprolitic soils (with blow counts of 10 or greater) passive pressure is generated over 3 times the soldier pile width.
- B) In clays, non-saprolitic silts, and saprolitic soils (with blow counts of 10 or less) passive pressure is generated over the width of the soldier pile.

Vertical component of anchor force must be resisted by embedded length of soldier piles below assumed excavation.

γ is the soil unit weight in pounds per cubic foot.

1. Ensure that the wall is compatible with horizontal and vertical criteria indicated on the Department plans.
2. Include the following on the design criteria for rock anchors:
1. Determine the tendon size to ensure that the anchor design load is no greater than 53 percent of the guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon.
2. Ensure that the free stressing length is no less than 15 ft. (4.5 m).
3. Estimate the bond length using the following equation:
Lb = P/(3.1416) (d) (tw)

where

- Lb= Bond length (not less than 10 ft. [3 m])
- P= Design load for the anchor
- d= Diameter of the drill hole
- tw= Bond stress in the interface between the rock and grout

When determining the bond stress, consider the critical nature of the anchor application, rock property variations, and installation procedures.

Section 617 — Permanent Anchored Walls

10. Include the following in the design criteria for soil anchors:

- a. Analyze the anchor structure system to ensure a well-anchored structure.
- b. Analyze the overall earth mass stability and the assumed failure plane to ensure that the anchor bond length is started at least 5 ft. (1.5 m) beyond the failure plane. Consider the following in the analysis:
- - • Type of foundation, nearness, and susceptibility to movement of adjacent buildings (see Figure 4).
- • Interaction of anchor groups when the anchor center-to-center spacing is less than or equal to 6 times the bulb diameter

c. Determine the tendon size so that the anchor design load does not exceed 53 percent of the guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon.
- d. Ensure that the free stressing length is at least 15 ft. (4.5 m).
- e. Use the existing theoretical and empirical methods only to predict anchor capacity for preliminary design estimates. Verify the final anchor capacity by field testing each anchor.

11. Retain a second registered Professional Engineer to operate independently from the Design Engineer Professional Engineer of Subsection 617.3.01.B. Have this Engineer independently check the design calculations and Plan details of the permanent anchored walls before submitting them to the Department for review.

# Section 617 — Permanent Anchored Walls

# B. Ground Movements and Load Transfer Instruments

The Department may install devices to monitor ground movements and load transfers during and after construction. The Department will schedule installation to minimize interference with the Contractor’s operations. Cooperate with the instrumentation installers. Anticipate delays of two to four hours per instrumented anchor. Although the Instrumentation Specialist maintains the instruments, assume responsibility for damage to the instruments, connections, or readouts from operations. Replace and install damaged equipment at the Department’s approval and at the Contractor’s expense.

# C. Rock Anchors

1. When required on the Plan or by the Engineer, use a prestressed rock anchor made of high-strength steel tendon fitted with a stressing anchorage at one end and a way to transfer force to the grout and rock on the other end.
2. Insert the rock anchor tendon into a prepared hole of suitable length and diameter, fixed to the rock, and stressed to a specified force. The basic components of a prestressed rock anchor are as listed below:
1. Prestressing steel may be single or multiple wires, strands, or bars. The rock anchor length is composed of these two parts:
- Bond length (socket)—the portion of the anchor that transmits the force to the surrounding rock
- Free length (stressing length)—the portion of the anchor free to elongate elastically during stressing
2. The stressing anchorage is the device that permits the stressing and anchoring of the prestressing steel under load.
3. The fixed anchorage is a mechanism opposite the stressing anchorage on the tendon that transfers the induced force to the surrounding grout or rock. Deformed bars and strand tendons do not have fixed anchorages since the anchor load is transferred to the grout by bond.
4. Provide grout, vent pipes, and miscellaneous appurtenances to inject the anchor grout. Pump grout through the drill casing or rods.

# D. Rock Anchor Installation

Install the rock anchors as follows:

1. Before installation, visit the site to observe existing conditions that may affect the work or design, if applicable, and to review the geotechnical data available for the project.
2. Drive or drill the holes for the anchors by core drilling, rotary drilling, auger drilling, or percussion drilling. If using water in the drilling operation, dispose of the water to minimize wall erosion. Repair water erosion damage to the site at no cost to the Department.
3. If the hole will not stand open, install casing to maintain a clean and open hole. Ensure that the hole diameter is at least 3 in (75 mm) if no pressure grouting is used. Pressure grouting is grouting with a pressure greater than 60 psi (415 kPa).
4. Ensure that the drill bit diameter is not less than 1/8 in. (3 mm) smaller than the specified hole diameter.
5. Start anchor holes within an angle tolerance of 1 to 3 degrees from the inclination specified on the approved design Plans. Do not allow holes to deviate from a straight line by more than 1 to 2 in. (25 to 50 mm) in 10 ft. (3 m). Do not allow holes to extend outside the Right-of-Way limits. Thoroughly clean holes of rock dust, rock chips, grease, or other material before inserting the tendon.
6. Install the tendon in the casing or in a hole drilled for the anchor. Ensure that the tendon’s corrosion protection is not damaged during handling or installation.

---

# Section 617 — Permanent Anchored Walls

1. Install the tendon in the bond length, to achieve at least 0.5 in. (13 mm) of grout cover. Degrease the bond length of strands or wires before installing by using Acetone, MEK, or MIBK. Do not leave residue on the tendon. Use other substances only after the Department’s approval. Include the costs of cleaning tendons in the price bid for Contract Items.
2. If using multi-element tendons without a fixed anchorage at the lower end, adequately space the tendon elements to achieve proper grout coverage.
3. NOTE: Do not use anchors to ground electric equipment and do not subject anchor tendons to sharp bends.

Provide centralizers spaced a maximum of 5 ft. (1.5 m) center to center throughout the bond length. Do not use wood spacers or other material harmful to the tendon steel or sheathing.
4. Inject the grout at the lowest point of the anchor and place over the entire anchor length.

Ensure that the grouting equipment can continuously mix and produce lump-free grout. Equip the grout pump nozzle with a grout pressure gauge capable of measuring pressure of at least 150 psi, (10 kPa) or twice the actual pressure used.
5. Base the material proportions used in the grout on grout tests made before beginning the grouting. Or, select the proportions based on prior documented experience with similar materials and equipment under comparable field conditions.
6. Use the minimum water content necessary for proper placement and do not exceed a water-cement ratio of 0.45. Do not leave grout in the mixer longer than 45 minutes. Only fill voids at the top of the free length with grout after final lock-off.

After grouting, do not disturb the tendon until the grout has reached a cube strength of 3,500 psi (25 MPa). Keep the mouth of the hole clean after grouting. Record the following data in a Project field book during the grouting operation:
- Type of mixer
- Water-cement ratio
- Type of additives
- Grout pressure
- Type cement
- Test sample strengths (before stressing)
- Volume of grout placed in bond and free lengths

If using pressure grouting, choose whether to perform a water tightness test. However, if injecting grout with a pressure of 60 psi (415 kPa) or less, always perform a water tightness test. Perform the test as follows:

Fill the entire hole in the rock with water and subject it to a pressure of 5 psi (35 kPa) in excess of the hydrostatic head as measured at the top of the hole.
If after 10 minutes the leakage rate from the hole exceeds 0.001 gal per inch diameter per foot of depth per minute (12 mL per 25 mm diameter per meter of depth per minute), consolidate grout, re-drill, and retest the hole. If the second water tightness test fails, repeat the entire process.
During the tests, observe holes adjacent to the hole being tested for water tightness to detect and seal inter-hole connections.
If finding artesian or flowing water in the drilled hole, maintain the pressure on the consolidation grout until the grout has initially set.

Section 617 — Permanent Anchored Walls

E. Cutting of Tendon Protrusions

After the Engineer accepts an anchor, the portion of the anchored tendon protruding over the anchor may be cut if it is not required for use in retesting. Cut the tendon according to the tendon manufacturer’s recommendations as approved by the Engineer. Do not damage the tendon anchor.

F. Redesign

If the anchors fail during performance tests or proof tests, modify the design or construction tests and procedures. The design is subject to Department review. These modifications may include:

- Reducing the anchor design load by increasing the number of anchors
- Increasing the grout pressure
- Requiring post-grouting or increasing the bond length

Modify the design or construction procedures, install the redesigned anchors in the wall, and test as previously defined at no cost to the Department. Anchors that fail the performance or proof tests may be incorporated in the wall. Propose a reduced design load and retest as noted above. The Department will determine acceptance of such anchors.

G. Soil Anchors

A prestressed soil anchor is a high-strength steel tendon fitted with a stressing anchor at one end and an anchor device that transfers force to the soil on the other end. These anchors are used in clay, silt, sand, or gravel and are inserted in a prepared hole that is drilled or driven into the ground.

The following are the two soil anchors considered for use:

- Friction type—rely on friction between the drilled borehole walls
- Anchor grout—rely on an enlarged pressure-grouted bulb or an underreamed bulb to provide resistance to pull-out

Test the soil anchors after placing the anchor grout and after the curing period. The basic components of the soil anchor are identical to the rock anchor as described previously. For installation, see Subsection 617.3.05.D, Rock Anchor Installation, except water tightness tests are not required. Test and stress soil anchors according to 617.3.06.A, Anchor Testing and Stressing except that 15% of the anchors remaining after the initial testing shall be performance tested.

H. Cutting of Tendon Protrusions

See Subsection 617.3.05.E, Cutting of Tendon Protrusions.

I. Redesign

See Subsection 617.3.05.F, Redesign.

# 617.3.06 Quality Acceptance

A. Anchor Testing and Stressing

Perform testing and stressing according to this subsection. Test each anchor to ensure that the maximum test load does not exceed 80 percent of the guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon. Performance test the first 2 anchors installed of each design load capacity and 5 to 10 percent of the remaining anchors (the Engineer will choose the locations). Proof test the remaining anchors.

1. Performance test by incrementally loading and unloading the anchor according to the following schedule.

1. Record the tendon movement at each increment to the nearest 0.001 in. (0.025 mm) referring to an independent fixed reference point.
2. Monitor the jack load with the production gauge and load cell calibrated as a set.
3. Adjust to a transfer load of 1.0P. Actual lock-off loads may be somewhat higher to account for seating losses.
4. To prevent misalignment of testing equipment, maintain an Alignment Load (AL) of at least 0.05P.
5. Hold the load at each increment long enough to obtain the movement reading.

---

# Section 617 — Permanent Anchored Walls

Submit the loading and unloading rates (tons [megagrams] per minute) for approval. Each load must be applied in less than 30 seconds after starting the jack pump.

1. Perform the creep test by holding the 1.50P load for 50 minutes while maintaining the load constant. Record the anchor movement (total movement) referenced to a fixed point at 30 seconds, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, and 50 minutes. Begin the observation time when the jack begins to load the anchor from 1.25P to the test load.
2. If performance tests indicate that the loaded substrata is sensitive to creep, maintain the load for an additional 250 minutes and record the movements at 60, 75, 90, 100, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, and 300 minutes.
3. Have the Engineer review the performance tests to determine if the anchor is acceptable. An anchor is acceptable if:
4. - The total movement obtained exceeds 80 percent of the theoretical elastic elongation of the free length and is less than the theoretical elastic elongation of the total of the free length plus 50 percent of the bond length.
- The creep movement does not exceed 0.08 in. (2.00 mm) during 5- to 50-minute time increments regardless of tendon length and load.
- If held for an additional 250 minutes, creep movement does not exceed 0.08 in (2.00 mm) from the 30-minute to the 300-minute time increment regardless of tendon length and load.

Perform proof tests as follows:

Section 617 — Permanent Anchored Walls

# 11. Use the following test equipment:

- Use a dial gauge that can measure elongation to the nearest 0.001 in. (0.025 mm).
- Use a production gauge with an accuracy of at least 0.5 to 1 percent of full scale with gradation no greater than 100 psi (690 kPa). Ensure that it has a non-parallax dial.
- Use test gauges with an accuracy of at least 0.25 of 1 percent of full scale with gradations no greater than 50 psi (345 kPa). Ensure that they have a non-parallax dial.
- Use a load cell with a resolution of at least 1/10 of 1 percent constructed to eliminate inaccuracy with uneven loading.
- Ensure that the jack, gauges, and load cell are calibrated as a set and independently. Check the pressure gauge and load cell calibration every week (or when erratic results are found) against a test gauge that is kept onsite for this purpose. Have the Department’s Inspector witness these calibration checks. Perform installation, testing, and stressing in the Department Inspector’s presence.

# 12. Perform lift-off tests when using anchors.

Make a lift-off reading after transferring the load to the end anchorage and before removing the jack.

- Determine the load within 5 percent of 1.00P. If the lift-off load is less than 0.95P, reset the end anchorage and make another lift-off reading.
- Perform additional lift-off tests 7 days after the load was locked-off in the anchor. After performing 5 additional lift-off tests, perform lift-off tests randomly. The total number of tests will be performed on no more than 10 percent of the remaining anchors.

1. Do not place pneumatically applied concrete under these conditions:
- The ambient temperature is below 40 °F (4 °C).
- The subgrade is frozen.
- Wind velocity prevents homogenous and uniform application.
2. Place the approved mix by pneumatic pressure through a machine with the proper amount of water for hydration applied at the mixing nozzle.
3. Maintain water pressure in the delivery pipe approximately 20 psi (140 kPa) above the air pressure in the machine.
4. Maintain a constant pressure of at least 45 psi (310 kPa) in the placing machine when the applicator hose length is 100 ft. (30 m) or less. Increase the pressure at least 5 psi (35 kPa) for each additional 50 ft. (15 m) of hose length or fraction thereof, or for each 25 ft. (7.5 m) vertically that the nozzle is above the machine.
5. When placing concrete on slopes pneumatically, limit the height to 8 ft. (2.5 m) lifts measured along the slope.
6. Direct the applicator nozzle to minimize rebound. Maintain the nozzle velocity at a constant level and rate determined by the job conditions.

# F. Finishing

After placing the concrete to the required depth and before the initial set, screed the surface and check it with a 10 ft. (3 m) straightedge. Immediately correct irregularities in excess of 0.25 in. in 10 ft. (6 mm in 3 m). Remove and replace loose areas of pneumatically applied concrete at the Contractor’s expense. Before application, protect the adjacent areas not to be covered and clean after application if necessary.
