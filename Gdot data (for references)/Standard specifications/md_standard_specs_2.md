Section 626 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Walls

# 626.3.02 Equipment

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 626.3.03 Preparation

# A. Prepare the Foundation

Before beginning construction, prepare the foundation as follows:

1. Grade the foundation for the mechanically stabilized embankment retaining wall level to a width equal to or exceeding the width of the reinforced volume and leveling pad. Use the top of the leveling pad as the grade elevation.
2. Before beginning the wall and leveling pad construction, compact the foundation to at least 95 percent of maximum laboratory dry density as determined by GDT 7.
3. Where walls are used as a bridge abutment, compact the foundation material as follows:
1. When a portion of the wall is a bridge abutment, ensure that portions of the wall within 100 ft. (30 m) of the lateral limits of the bridge have foundation material compacted to at least 100 percent of maximum laboratory dry density as determined by GDT 7.
2. When walls are used solely as bridge abutments, compact the foundation material for the entire wall to at least 100 percent of maximum laboratory dry density as determined by GDT 7. Place and compact the embankment beneath the wall according to Section 208.
4. If excavating below the leveling pad elevation, reconstruct the area as embankment.
5. Remove and replace foundation soils that are incapable of sustaining the required compaction as directed by the Office of Materials and Research.
6. At each panel foundation level, provide a non-reinforced concrete leveling pad as shown on the plans.
1. Place leveling pads so they are level within 1/8 in (3 mm) per pad or per 10 ft. (3 m), whichever length is greater.
2. Repair or replace leveling pads that do not meet this requirement as directed by the Engineer at the Contractor’s expense.
3. If using bearing pads on the leveling pad on the initial row of panels, also use them on all the leveling pads of that wall.
4. Fill the horizontal joint between the leveling pad and panels with 2 in. by 2 in. (50 mm by 50 mm) polyether foam strips and cover with filter cloth.
5. Use neoprene strips 3/16 in. (5 mm) thick as necessary to level panels. Do not use more than 3/8 in. (10 mm) of neoprene strips.
6. If more leveling is required, take other corrective action, such as replacing the leveling pad or replacing panels.
7. Embed the wall at least 5 ft (1.5 m) into an embankment, when shown on the plans. Construct the embankment before constructing the leveling pad and placing backfill for the wall. For step details on leveling pads, see plans and construction details.

# 626.3.04 Fabrication

# A. Soil-Reinforcing Devices

Have steel soil-reinforcing devices shop fabricated. Use shop fabricated steel mesh of cold drawn steel welded into the finished mesh fabric according to ASTM A 185. Cut soil-reinforcing devices to lengths and tolerances shown on the Plans. Punch holes for bolts in the location shown. Ensure that soil-reinforcing devices are true to size and free of defects that may impair the strength or durability.

1051

---

Section 626 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Walls

B. Connecting Devices

Use connecting devices of the dimensions shown on the Plans. Assemble connecting members and soil-reinforcing devices before galvanizing the connecting devices. Ensure that the connecting devices are true to size and are free of defects that may impair the strength or durability.

Tie strips may be partially bent to no more than a 1 in. (25 mm) radius before they are shipped to the precast yard. Perform final bending at the precast yard.

Do not allow connecting devices, reinforcing steel, or welded wire fabric used in the panels to contact each other.

C. Bolts and Nuts

Ensure that the nominal diameter is as defined in Subsection 626.2.B, Connecting Devices.

- Mesh attachment straps
- Coil embeds
- Coil bolts
- Reinforcing steel
- Welded wire fabric
- Connecting pins
- Handling devices

Do not allow the metal connecting devices and reinforcing steel to contact each other when in their final position in the panel.

1. Testing and Inspection

Use precast concrete panels that are cast at a Class A or B plant that conforms to Standard Operating Procedure 3, Precast/Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members. See QPL 9 for a list of approved plants.
2. Casting

Cast the panels using steel forms.
1. Cast the front face of the panel (the face exposed to view when installed in the wall) against a steel form or architectural form liner. Float finish the back face.
2. Place the concrete in each panel without interruption and consolidate it using an approved vibrator. Supplement vibration with hand tamping as necessary to force the concrete into the corners of the forms and prevent the formation of stone pockets or cleavage planes from forming.
3. Use clear form oil from only one manufacturer throughout the casting operation.
3. Curing

Cure the panels as specified in Subsection 500.3.05.Z, Cure Concrete, or Subsection 865.2.01.B.10, Concrete Curing. Cure for at least 12 hours or until the concrete develops the specified compressive strength. The Engineer will reject panels that do not reach specified strength within 28 days.
4. Removing Forms

Keep forms in place until they can be removed without damaging the panel.

1052

---

Section 626 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Walls

# 5. Concrete Finishing and Tolerances

Finish the concrete surface for the front face as designated on the Plans. Float-finish the rear face enough to eliminate open aggregate pockets and distortions greater than 1/4 in. (6 mm).

Only use panels manufactured within the following tolerances:

- All dimensions are within 3/16 in. (5 mm).
- Angular distortion in the panel’s height does not exceed 3/16 in. (5 mm) in 5 ft. (1.5 m).
- Diagonal tolerance from Plan dimensions is no more than 3/8 in. (10 mm).

For textured finishes, surface defects greater than 5/16 in. (8 mm) in 5 ft (1.5 m) will be rejected.

# 6. Determining Compressive Strength

Perform compression tests to determine the minimum strength requirements on cylinders.

1. Make at least three cylinders to determine when the units may be put into service from each day’s production and cure according to GDT 35.D.B.6. Make two additional cylinders from each day’s production or from each 10 cubic yards of concrete placed, whichever is the lesser amount of concrete, to determine the 28-day strength.
2. Ensure that the shipping strength is equal to the required 28-day strength for each day’s production or for each 10 yd³ (7.5 m³) of concrete placed, whichever amount of concrete is less.
3. Cure according to GDT 35.D.B.6. Ensure that the 28-day compressive strength is at least 4,000 psi (28 MPa). Perform compressive strength tests according to AASHTO T 22.

# 7. Rejection

Panels will be rejected if they do not meet the requirements above. The following defects are also cause for rejection:

- Indications of imperfect molding that result in tolerances being exceeded
- Honeycombed or open texture concrete

# 8. Marking

Clearly and permanently mark on the rear face of each panel the date of manufacture, lot number, and type of panel.

# E. Precast Coping and Precast Traffic Barrier

To construct the precast portion of the coping or precast traffic barrier, use materials that conform to Subsection 626.2.C, Concrete. Use the same procedures for pre-casting, testing, and inspection as those for pre-cast panels.

# 626.3.05 Construction

# A. Wall Erection

Place precast panels so that their final position at the completion of the wall is vertical.

1. Adjust the batter to allow for the effect of backfill type, equipment, and construction method on panel movement.
2. In general, batter the panels 1/2 in. (10 mm) in 4 ft. (1 m) into the reinforced volume to allow the panel to move during backfill placement and compaction.
3. Place panels in successive horizontal lifts as backfill is placed.
1. When placing backfill behind a panel, maintain the panel in a vertical position by placing clamps and temporary wooden wedges in the joints at the junction of two adjacent panels on the external side of the wall.
2. Use external bracing for the initial lift. Keep the wedges in place until the fourth layer of panels is placed, then remove the bottom layer of wedges.
3. Remove each succeeding layer of wedges when placing the succeeding panel layers.

Section 626 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Walls

d. When the wall is completed, remove the wedges. Do not use the wedges to level the panels on leveling pads.

e. Remove the wedges placed below the groundline on the front face of the wall before backfilling this area.

# 4. Alignment and tolerance are as follows:

a. Ensure that the horizontal and vertical joint openings between panels are uniform. Ensure that the opening is 7/8 in. ± 3/8 in. (22 mm ± 10 mm).

b. Ensure that the vertical tolerance (plumbness) and horizontal alignment tolerance as the wall is constructed does not exceed 3/4 in. (20 mm) when measured along a 10 ft. (3 m) straightedge.

c. Ensure that the overall vertical tolerance of the wall (plumbness from top to bottom) in its final position does not exceed 1/2 in. per 10 ft. (13 mm per 3 m) of wall height.

d. Place cast-in-place concrete on top of the wall panel to bring the precast coping elements on top of the wall to proper grade. See the plans or construction details. Before placing special backfill material on a soil-reinforcing device, complete the connections to the panels.

# B. Joint Fillers

Treat joints between the panels as follows:

1. In flood plains or other intermittently inundated areas, cover the joints as follows:
- Use a woven plastic filter fabric sheet to cover the joint on the back side of the wall between panels from 3 ft. (1 m) above the 100-year flood elevation to the bottom of the wall.
- Use a woven or nonwoven plastic filter fabric sheet to cover the joint on the back side of the wall between panels from 3 ft. (1 m) above the 100-year high-water elevation to the top of the wall.
2. At other locations, cover joints between panels with a woven or nonwoven plastic filter fabric sheet.
3. Ensure that horizontal joints between panels contain two 4 by 3 by ¾ in. (100 by 75 by 20 mm) ribbed bearing pads or elastomeric pads as specified on the Plans. Use ribbed bearing pads that are SBR rubber with a durometer hardness of 80 plus or minus 10 as required in ASTM D 2240.
4. Use elastomeric pads that are 100 percent virgin chloroprene (neoprene) meeting the requirements of the 1992 AASHTO Specifications for Highway Bridges, Section 18, Elastomeric Bearings.
5. Caulk the openings on either side of and between the pads with 2 by 2 in. (50 by 50 mm) open cell urethane foam strips, or equal as approved by the Engineer in addition to other required joint treatments.
6. Caulk vertical joints with 2 by 2 in. (50 by 50 m) or open cell urethane foam strips. When piecing the urethane foam strips together, overlap them at least 4 in. (100 mm).
7. Ensure that the minimum width of the plastic filter fabric sheets are as follows:
- For vertical joints: 18 in. (450 mm) wide
- For horizontal joints: 12 in. (300 mm) wide
8. Overlap the filter fabric with the joint at least 4 in. (100 mm).
9. When piecing the filter fabric together, overlap at least 4 in. (100 mm).
10. Glue the filter fabric to the panels. Use an adhesive on QPL 58.

# C. MSE Wall Backfill

Section 626 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Walls

1. Place backfill lift to a uniform thickness and place it from the back face of the wall to 1 ft. (300 mm) beyond the end of the soil-reinforcing devices.
2. At each soil-reinforcing device level, compact the backfill to the full length of reinforcing devices and slope it to drain away from the wall before placing and attaching the next layer of reinforcing devices.
3. Level the compacted backfill with the connecting device before connecting the reinforcing device.
4. Repair damaged soil reinforcing devices or panels before attaching and backfilling the reinforcing devices.
5. Place soil reinforcing devices at 90 degrees to the face of the wall, unless otherwise indicated on the plans or by the Engineer.
6. Ensure that the maximum lift thickness is 8 in. (200 mm) (loose) and closely follows panel erection. Decrease this lift thickness to obtain the specified density, if required.
7. Compact the embankment backfill material to at least 100 percent of maximum laboratory dry density as determined by GDT 7 or GDT 24a, GDT 24b Method A or B, for full depth of the material.
8. Compact the embankment backfill material without disturbing or displacing the reinforcing devices and panels.
9. Compact from the area nearest the wall face to the back of the reinforcing devices except for a strip 3 ft. (1 m) wide adjacent to the backside of the wall. After compacting the remainder of the layer, compact this 3 ft. (1 m) strip with light mechanical tampers without causing the panels to move outward.
10. Whenever a compaction test fails on a special embankment backfill lift, do not place additional material over that area until the lift is re-compacted and obtains a passing compaction test.
11. Ensure that the stabilizing geogrid at any layer is held taut, by mechanical means, free of wrinkles, bends or undulations until the special backfill material has been placed and compacted above the restrained layer to the level of the next layer of stabilizing geogrid. Release the uppermost layer of stabilizing geogrid after the final layer of special backfill is placed and compacted.

# D. Storm Drains

Provide precast panels that have the appropriate storm drain openings into panels at the elevation and locations indicated on drainage profiles. Place catch basins so that pipes will enter perpendicular (plan view) to the panels or below the leveling pads as shown on the Plans. Coordinate the catch basin construction and the storm drain placement with the wall construction.

# E. Dewatering

Furnish, install, operate, and maintain satisfactory dewatering systems to maintain the site in a dry and workable condition to permit grading, compacting the wall foundation, and erecting and backfilling the wall. Furnish dewatering system equipment and materials and continue the system as long as necessary.

# F. Catch Basins and Longitudinal Pipes

When catch basins are located behind the wall and the Wall Plans do not indicate a specific construction method, use the method outlined in the construction details. When longitudinal pipes are located behind the wall, follow this procedure if specific details are not shown on the Wall plans:

1. Bend the soil-reinforcing device around the pipe without damaging the device, its coating, or its attachment to the precast panel. See the construction details.
2. If the pipe is too close to the wall to bend the soil-reinforcing device without damaging it, the Engineer will investigate relocating the pipe. The Engineer will contact the design office that designed the drainage system or the office responsible for the pipe and will investigate the pipe relocation.



---

Section 626 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Walls

3. If the pipe cannot be relocated or if the pipe is too large for relocation to be feasible, use the back-up panel procedure indicated on the construction details.

Use precast concrete or cast-in-place concrete for:

- Drainage structures that are within the special embankment backfill
- Drainage structures that are outside the special embankment backfill but that are within 5 ft. (1.5 m) of the front face of the wall

Section 627 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Wall—Contractor Design

1. For MSE walls that are intersected by a box culvert, detail the soil reinforcement devices over the box culverts to a length equal to the soil reinforcement devices in the adjacent sections.
2. Assume responsibility for all temporary shoring that may be necessary for wall construction. Design the shoring using sound engineering principles.
3. Use permanent concrete wall facing panels that are at least 5 1/2 in (139 mm) thick.
4. Provide a minimum length of soil reinforcement of 10 feet (3 m) or seven-tenths (0.7) of the wall height, whichever is greater.
5. At any section of wall, detail all soil reinforcement devices the same, including length, cross section, and corrosive protection.
6. Positively connect all soil reinforcement devices to the precast panels.
7. Ensure that the special wall backfill extends a minimum of 12 in (300 mm) past the end of the soil reinforcement.
8. For MSE Walls at Bridge Ends:
1. Ensure that MSE wall backfill extends vertically to the bottom of the approach slab.
2. Ensure that the MSE wall backfill extends horizontally to the back limit of the MSE backfill for the wall below the approach slab or 12 inches (300 mm) beyond the end of the stabilizing devices attached to the bridge, whichever is greater.
3. Show details of attachments to be cast into the bridge end bent and backwall.
4. Do not make attachments to bridge endwalls that are integral to the bridge superstructure and are subject to movement due to superstructure expansion and contraction.
9. Use the Architectural treatment of facing panels as indicated on the Department’s drawings.
10. Provide internal walls to allow for future widening if shown on the wall plans. Ensure the internal walls have galvanized wire or concrete facing. Ensure as a minimum that the facing of the internal walls extend to the back limit of the MSE Wall Backfill for the permanent wall.
11. Ensure the maximum panel area does not exceed 35 square feet (3.25 square meters).
12. A Foundation Investigation Report may be available from the Geotechnical Engineering Bureau of the Department. The information contained in this report may be used by the Contractor to assist in evaluating existing conditions for design as well as construction. However, the accuracy of the information is not guaranteed and no requests for additional monies or time extensions will be considered as a result of the Contractor relying on the information in this report.
13. Ensure the following requirements are met:
1. The gutterline grade on the proposed top of wall submitted matches the gutter elevations required by the plans.
2. The top of coping is at or above the top of coping shown on the envelope.
3. The leveling pad is at or below the elevation shown on the wall envelope.
4. Any approved changes in Wall Envelope quantities due to the approved survey verification are noted in the contractor’s plans as Adjusted Wall Envelope Quantities.
5. All changes in quantities due to the proposed walls being outside the wall envelope (step locations, ending wall at full panel, etc.) are shown as Material Quantities.
14. Ensure the minimum embedment of the wall (top of leveling pad) is at least 2 feet (600 mm). If the soil slopes away from the bottom of the wall, lower the bottom of the wall to provide a minimum horizontal distance of 10 ft. (3 m) to the slope. [i.e. a 2:1 slope in front of the wall requires 5 ft. (1.5 m) of embedment; a 4:1 slope in front of the wall requires 2.5 ft. (750 mm) of embedment]

# 627.3.04 Fabrication

# A. Soil-Reinforcing Devices

Have steel soil-reinforcing devices shop fabricated. Use shop fabricated steel mesh of cold drawn steel welded into the finished mesh fabric according to ASTM A 1064/A 1064M.

Cut soil-reinforcing devices to lengths and tolerances shown on the Plans. Punch holes for bolts in the location shown. Ensure that soil-reinforcing devices are true to size and free of defects that may impair the strength or durability.

Section 627 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Wall—Contractor Design

B. Connecting Devices

Use connecting devices of the dimensions shown on the Plans. Assemble connecting members and soil-reinforcing devices before galvanizing the connecting devices. Ensure that the connecting devices are true to size and are free of defects that may impair the strength or durability.

Tie strips may be partially bent to no more than a 1 in. (25 mm) radius before they are shipped to the precast yard. Perform final bending at the precast yard.

Do not allow connecting devices, reinforcing steel, or welded wire fabric used in the panels to contact each other.

C. Bolts and Nuts

Use bolts and nuts that meet the requirements defined in Subsection 627.2.B, Connecting Devices.

D. Precast Panels

Use precast panel materials as specified in Subsection 627.2, Materials. Before casting, set the following in place to the dimensions and tolerances shown on the drawings:

- Tie strips
- Mesh attachment straps
- Coil embeds
- Coil bolts
- Reinforcing steel
- Welded wire fabric
- Connecting pins
- Handling devices

Do not allow the metal connecting devices and reinforcing steel to contact each other when in their final position in the panel.

1. Testing and Inspection
Use precast concrete panels that are cast at a Class A or B plant that conforms to Standard Operating Procedure 3, Precast/Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members. See QPL 9 for a list of approved plants.
2. Casting
Cast the panels using steel forms.

1. Cast the front face of the panel (the face exposed to view when installed in the wall) against a steel form or architectural form liner. Float finish the back face.
2. Place the concrete in each panel without interruption and consolidate it using an approved vibrator. Supplement vibration with hand tamping as necessary to force the concrete into the corners of the forms and prevent the formation of stone pockets or cleavage planes from forming.
3. Use clear form oil from only one manufacturer throughout the casting operation.
3. Curing
Cure the panels as specified in Subsection 500.3.05.Z, Cure Concrete, or Subsection 865.2.01.B.10, Concrete Curing. Cure for at least 12 hours or until the concrete develops the specified compressive strength. The Engineer will reject panels that do not reach specified strength within 28 days.
4. Removing Forms
Keep forms in place until they can be removed without damaging the panel.

Section 627 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Wall—Contractor Design

# 5. Concrete Finishing and Tolerances

Finish the concrete surface for the front face as designated on the Plans. Float-finish the rear face enough to eliminate open aggregate pockets and distortions greater than 1/4 in. (6 mm).

Only use panels manufactured within the following tolerances:

- All dimensions are within 3/16 in. (5 mm).
- Angular distortion in the panel’s height does not exceed 3/16 in. (5 mm) in 5 ft. (1.5 m).
- Diagonal tolerance from Plan dimensions is no more than 3/8 in. (10 mm).

For textured finishes, surface defects greater than 5/16 in. (8 mm) in 5 ft (1.5 m) will be rejected.

# 6. Determining Compressive Strength

Perform compression tests to determine the minimum strength requirements on cylinders.

1. Make at least three cylinders to determine when the units may be put into service from each day’s production and cure according to GDT 35.D.1.
2. Make two additional cylinders from each day’s production or from each 10 cubic yards of concrete placed, whichever is the lesser amount of concrete, to determine the 28-day strength.
3. Ensure that the shipping strength is equal to the required 28-day strength for each day’s production or for each 10 yd³ (7.5 m³) of concrete placed, whichever amount of concrete is less.
4. Cure according to GDT 35.D.1. Ensure that the 28-day compressive strength is at least 4,000 psi (28 MPa). Perform compressive strength tests according to AASHTO T 22.

# 7. Rejection

Panels will be rejected if they do not meet the requirements above. The following defects are also cause for rejection:

- Indications of imperfect molding that result in tolerances being exceeded
- Honeycombed or open texture concrete

# 8. Marking

Clearly and permanently mark on the rear face of each panel the date of manufacture, lot number, and type of panel.

# E. Precast Coping and Precast Traffic Barrier

To construct the precast portion of the coping or precast traffic barrier, use materials that conform to Subsection 627.2.C, Concrete. Use the same procedures for precasting, testing, and inspection as those for precast panels.

# 627.3.05 Construction

# A. Wall Erection

Place precast panels so that their final position at the completion of the wall is vertical.

1. Adjust the batter to allow for the effect of backfill type, equipment, and construction method on panel movement.
2. In general, batter the panels 1/2 in. (10 mm) in 4 ft. (1 m) into the reinforced volume to allow the panel to move during backfill placement and compaction.
3. Place panels in successive horizontal lifts as backfill is placed.
1. When placing backfill behind a panel, maintain the panel in a vertical position by placing clamps and temporary wooden wedges in the joints at the junction of two adjacent panels on the external side of the wall.
2. Use external bracing for the initial lift. Keep the wedges in place until the fourth layer of panels is placed, then remove the bottom layer of wedges.
3. Remove each succeeding layer of wedges when placing the succeeding panel layers.
4. When the wall is completed, remove the wedges. Do not use the wedges to level the panels on leveling pads.
5. Remove the wedges placed below the groundline on the front face of the wall before backfilling this area.

Section 627 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Wall—Contractor Design

4. Alignment and tolerance are as follows:

- a. Ensure that the horizontal and vertical joint openings between panels are uniform. Ensure that the opening is 7/8 in. ± 3/8 in. (22 mm ± 10 mm).
- b. Ensure that the vertical tolerance (plumbness) and horizontal alignment tolerance as the wall is constructed does not exceed 3/4 in. (20 mm) when measured along a 10 ft. (3 m) straightedge.
- c. Ensure that the overall vertical tolerance of the wall (plumbness from top to bottom) in its final position does not exceed 1/2 in. per 10 ft. (13 mm per 3 m) of wall height.
- d. Place cast-in-place concrete on top of the wall panel as needed to bring the precast coping elements on top of the wall to proper grade. See the plans or construction details. Before placing special backfill material on a soil-reinforcing device, complete the connections to the panels.

B. Joint Fillers

Treat joints between the panels as follows:

1. 1. Bearing Pads
Ensure that horizontal joints between panels contain two 4 by 3 by ¾ in (100 by 75 by 20 mm) ribbed bearing pads or elastomeric pads as specified on the Plans.
2. 2. Filter Fabric
Cover all horizontal and vertical joints with 12 in. (300 mm) wide plastic filter fabric sheet glued securely to the backside of precast concrete panels. Overlap the filter fabric with the joint at least 4 in. (100 mm). When piecing the filter fabric together, overlap at least 4 in. (100 mm).

In flood plains or other intermittently inundated areas, cover the joints as follows:

- • Use a woven plastic filter fabric sheet to cover the joint on the back side of the wall between panels from 3 ft. (1 m) above the 100-year flood elevation to the bottom of the wall.
- • Use a woven or nonwoven plastic filter fabric sheet to cover the joint on the back side of the wall between panels from 3 ft. (1 m) above the 100-year flood elevation to the top of the wall.

C. MSE Wall Backfill

Place backfill shortly after erecting each lift panel. Follow these guidelines:

1. 1. Place backfill lift to a uniform thickness and place it from the back face of the wall to 1 ft. (300 mm) beyond the end of the soil-reinforcing devices.
2. 2. At each soil-reinforcing device level, compact the backfill to the full length of reinforcing devices and slope it to drain away from the wall before placing and attaching the next layer of reinforcing devices.
3. 3. Level the compacted backfill with the connecting device before connecting the reinforcing device.
4. 4. Repair damaged soil reinforcing devices or panels before attaching and backfilling the reinforcing devices.
5. 5. Place soil reinforcing devices at 90 degrees to the face of the wall, unless otherwise indicated on the Plans or by the Engineer.
6. 6. Ensure that the maximum lift thickness is 8 in. (200 mm) (loose) and closely follows panel erection. Decrease this lift thickness to obtain the specified density, if required.
7. 7. Compact the embankment backfill material to at least 100 percent of maximum laboratory dry density as determined by GDT 7 or GDT 24a, GDT 24b Method A or B, for full depth of the material.
8. 8. Compact the embankment backfill material without disturbing or displacing the reinforcing devices and panels.
9. 9. Compact from the area nearest the wall face to the back of the reinforcing devices except for a strip 3 ft. (1 m) wide adjacent to the backside of the wall. After compacting the remainder of the layer, compact this 3 ft. (1 m) strip with light mechanical tampers without causing the panels to move outward.
10. 10. Whenever a compaction test fails on a special embankment backfill lift, do not place additional material over that area until the lift is re-compacted and obtains a passing compaction test.

1070

Section 627 — Mechanically Stabilized Embankment Retaining Wall—Contractor Design

11. Ensure that the stabilizing geogrid at any layer is held taut, by mechanical means, free of wrinkles, bends or undulations until the special backfill material has been placed and compacted above the restrained layer to the level of the next layer of stabilizing geogrid. Release the uppermost layer of stabilizing geogrid after the final layer of special backfill is placed and compacted.

# D. Storm Drains

Provide precast panels that have the appropriate storm drain openings in panels at the elevation and locations indicated on drainage profiles. Place catch basins so that pipes will enter perpendicular (plan view) to the panels or below the leveling pads as shown on the Plans. Coordinate the catch basin construction and the storm drain placement with the wall construction.

# E. Dewatering

Furnish, install, operate, and maintain satisfactory dewatering systems to maintain the site in a dry and workable condition to permit grading, compacting the wall foundation, and erecting and backfilling the wall. Furnish dewatering system equipment and materials and continue the system as long as necessary.

# F. Catch Basins and Longitudinal Pipes

When catch basins are located behind the wall and the Wall Plans do not indicate a specific construction method, use the method outlined in the construction details. When longitudinal pipes are located behind the wall, follow this procedure if specific details are not shown on the Wall Plans:

1. Bend the soil-reinforcing device around the pipe without damaging the device, its coating, or its attachment to the precast panel. See the construction details.
2. If the pipe is too close to the wall to bend the soil-reinforcing device without damaging it, the Engineer will investigate relocating the pipe. The Engineer will contact the design office that designed the drainage system or the office responsible for the pipe and will investigate the pipe relocation.
3. If the pipe cannot be relocated or if the pipe is too large for relocation to be feasible, use the back-up panel procedure indicated on the construction details.

Use precast concrete or cast-in-place concrete for:

- Drainage structures that are within the special embankment backfill
- Drainage structures that are outside the special embankment backfill but that are within 5 ft. (1.5 m) of the front face of the wall

2. Use PCMS on Interstate, limited access and multi-lane divided highways when any of these conditions exist:

- a. Workers or equipment operating within 2 ft. (600 mm) of a travel lane without appropriate traffic control devices for positive barrier protection.
- b. Excavation or other construction creates drop-offs adjacent to the edge of a travel lane and channelization devices are placed within the travel lane that is adjacent to the drop-off.
- c. Material hauling in or out of a travel lane by hauling vehicles requires traffic to slow in the temporary traffic control zone.
- d. Traffic is delayed by pacing all lanes for short periods of time for placing bridge beams, overhead sign structures, blasting, etc.
- e. Any time that divided highway traffic is required to operate as two-way traffic condition and traffic is not separated by a positive barrier system.
- f. One mile in advance of lane closure, place PCMS on outside shoulder denoting appropriate lane closure one mile ahead.

3. Use PCMS on all other types of roadways according to the traffic control plan or as directed by the Engineer.

4. Locate the PCMS near the construction activity and display a message that is both concise and meaningful. Obtain the Engineer’s approval for messages used on the PCMS.

5. Include the location of the PCMS and any message to be displayed on the PCMS in the approved traffic control plan required in Section 150-Traffic Control.

6. For emergency situations, PCMS that are smaller in size and do not have all of the capabilities outlined in this Specification, may be used until a PCMS that meets these requirements can be located and placed in operation at the site. The Engineer will determine when conditions and situations are to be considered emergencies and will regulate the length of time that non-specification PCMS may be used. Provide the Engineer written notification when non-specification PCMS signs are in use on the work.

# B. PCMS Phase Messages

Only one type of demountable characters (letters, numerals, symbols, and borders) is permitted on special roadside signs on each project.

# B. Erecting the Signs

# 1. Drive Type Posts

Drive type posts may be driven in place or placed in prepared holes.

- Use driven posts only in firm and stable soil. If the soil is sandy or unstable, place each drive type post in a prepared dry hole of at least a 4 in. (100 mm) diameter.
- When placing posts in prepared holes:
1. Backfill the holes with a mixture of damp, clean friable soil and 8 percent by volume Portland cement.
2. Thoroughly tamp the mixture in place around the posts.
- Erect posts vertically as deep and at an angle to the roadway as shown on the Plans or as directed.
- Do not penetrate posts in the coastal plain region less than 4 ft. (1.2 m) or 3 ft. (1 m) for posts in the Piedmont and the Valley and Ridge Regions when no guard rail is present. When erecting signs behind a guard rail, penetrate at least 3 ft. (1 m) for posts 14 ft. (4.2 m) or less long, or 4 ft. (1.2 m) for posts over 14 ft. (4.2 m) long.

# 2. Single-Plate Signs

Erect single-plate signs 9 ft.² (0.84 m²) or less on one drive-type post unless otherwise specified on the plans. Erect single-plate signs greater than 9 ft.² (0.84 m²) on two drive-type posts. Leave enough distance between the two posts to fit the mounting holes in the sign plate.

# 3. Steel Posts for Mast Arm Assemblies

- Erect steel posts for mast arm assemblies in a concrete foundation according to the plans. Erect at the place, height, and angle to the roadway specified.
- After curing the concrete foundation for at least 24 hours, securely fasten the specified signs into place on the mast arm.

- Ensure that the bottom of the sign is 18 in. (450 mm) above the top of the lighting fixture.
- Ensure that the sign has ample bracing for mounting the sign support so that each sign can withstand 1 in. (25 mm) of ice accumulated on the entire sign and wind pressures shown on the plans.
- Ensure that the top of each sign is three degrees off perpendicular from the bottom of the sign. Use the three-degree slant to lean the sign toward the approaching traffic.

# C. Foundations (for Special Roadside Signs)

Do not disturb the natural ground adjacent to a foundation more than necessary to construct the footing.

1. Excavate for the footings to the lines and elevations shown on the Plans or established by the Engineer. Do not disturb or loosen the foundation below these elevations.
2. Use forms of the necessary shape and dimensions to construct the footings to the lines and elevations shown on the plans.
3. Cure the concrete foundations, constructed in conformance with Section 500 and the plan details, at least 7 days before erecting the sign.
4. Ensure that the minimum lengths of steel H piling used in the foundations of ground-mounting signs are accepted and meet the plan penetration requirements. The Plan quantity of steel H piling is shown for estimating purposes only; determine and provide the necessary lengths of piles.
5. Before driving the piles, furnish a list of proposed pile lengths to the Engineer.
- Use full-length piles or built-up piles with a maximum of two splices that are made in the presence of the Engineer.
- Furnish satisfactory identification for all piles or portions thereof.
6. When rock prevents the penetration required on the plans, construct according to the notes and details shown on the plans.
7. The minimum energy ratings required by Section 520 for pile hammers will be waived for constructing ground-mounted sign supports. Jetting is not permitted.
8. Place required backfilling in layers no greater than 6 in. (150 mm) thick and thoroughly compact it to the approximate density of the undisturbed soil in the area.

# B. Power Supply and Wiring

Use cable and wire of sufficient size to safely carry the capacity intended and to prevent the voltage from dropping more than 5 percent from the service point to the farthest light.

# 1. Determine Cable and Wire Sizes

If the cable size is not specified on the plans, determine the safe size after studying the plans and specifications. Wire and cable sizes as indicated below are for copper. Do not use aluminum wire unless otherwise noted on the plans. Acceptable copper cable and wire sizes (commercial) are as follows:

| No. 2/0 AWG | 19 strand |
| ----------- | --------- |
| No. 1/0 AWG | 19 strand |
| No. 2 AWG   | 7 strand  |
| No. 4 AWG   | 7 strand  |
| No. 6 AWG   | 7 strand  |

Use smaller wire sizes (No. 10 AWG minimum) on the sign structure only if it is adequately protected with fuses inside the handhole of the structural support. Ensure that the fuse rating is the same as the ampere rating of the wire, such as 30 A for No. 10 AWG wire. Do not reduce the wire size to a size that carries more than 80 percent of its rated amperage. If the number of luminaires on the sign structure is too many for No. 10 AWG wire, run two separate circuits from the base of the structural support to the luminaires. Fuse each of these separate circuits at the handhole of the sign structure.

# 2. Insulate Wire and Cable

The neutral/ground wire shall have white insulation or mark it with strips of white tape at each access point. On the cable installed underground, use 600 V, type RHH/RHW/USE, 75 °C insulation. On the cable installed on the sign structure and connected to the luminaires, use 600 V, type RHH, XHHW, or THHN, 90 °C insulation. Install a waterproof boot, furnished by the fuse holder manufacturer, over each end of the fuse holder.

# C. Power Control

When noted on the Plans, furnish and install a lighting contactor and a photoelectric control, complete with receptacle and accessories. Mount the photoelectric control near the top of the service pole so that it is exposed to the north sky. The control shall provide ON operation as shown in Subsection 637.2.I, Photoelectric Controls.

# D. Grounding Rods

Use ground rods 5/8 in. (16 mm) in diameter (± 1/16 in. [± 1.6 mm]) and 8 ft. (2.4 m) long unless otherwise specified on the plans. Use ground rods that are galvanized steel. Ensure that the galvanization coating is at least 2 ounces/ft.² (610 g/m²) according to the requirements of ASTM A 153/A 153 M.

# A. General

Use aluminum or steel supports for signs. Steel supports shall be galvanized after fabrication. Connections may be welded, bolted, riveted, or fastened by other means if the connecting method ensures adequate strength and does not distract from the aesthetics of the structure. Do not weld splice structural members.

Fabricate columns, chords, and struts from one piece of material by using one longitudinal seam weld. Bolted splicing of truss chords may be allowed if shown on approved shop drawings. Use struts to brace all truss chords.

Provide an electrical outlet on the front horizontal chord with a cover for connecting to the power source or for future use. Weld into the column near the base the column with the conduit in the foundation, a handhole assembly, curved on the front to follow the contour of the column. Ensure that the handhole reinforcing frame has a tapped hole to accommodate the grounding lug and secure a cover to the frame with at least two screws. The column shall have a J-hook wire support welded inside near the top.

Provide brackets for mounting signs. These brackets shall be adjustable to permit mounting the sign faces at any angle between a truly vertical position and three degrees from vertical. Obtain this three-degree angle by rotating the top edge of the sign downward toward approaching traffic. All brackets shall be equal in length to the vertical dimension of the signs being supported.

# B. Welding

All welding shall be done in the shop by current GDOT certified welders. The welders will weld the steel structures according to the latest AWS Structural Welding Code as modified by the GDOT Specifications and will weld aluminum structures according to Subsection 638.1.02.

# C. Fabrication and Testing

# A. Protection of Metal

During shipment and handling, protect all metal components to prevent damage to galvanized coatings. Handle galvanized steel components with rope slings or alternate methods approved by the Office of Materials and Testing before use. Do not use metal slings, chains, or hooks on galvanized surfaces. Repair minor damage to galvanizing, as determined by the Engineer, according to Sections 645. Metal components will be rejected if they have extensive damage to galvanizing.

# B. Foundations

For construction methods, see Sections 207, 500, and 511. Chamfer the edges of the stems 3/4 in. (19 mm). Stems shall have a Type III finish to at least 6 in. (150 mm) below the finished ground surface unless otherwise noted on the plans. The Engineer shall inspect the anchor bolt assembly installation before the placement of concrete. Complete the anchor bolt assembly installations so as to prevent movement during the concrete placement. Tolerance for the placement of anchor bolt assemblies shall be 3/8 in. (10 mm) horizontally and 1:20 (3 degrees) vertically. Do not remove the temporary template until the footing and stem concrete have been in place at least 24 hours. The Office of Materials and Testing (OMAT) shall inspect the Type II and V sign structure footings before the column is erected. OMAT will perform a second inspection after the column is erected and will also perform ultrasonic testing of the anchor bolts at this time. Type II and V sign structures will not be accepted until the footing inspections have been performed and approved.

# C. Erection

Erecting the structure shall include placing and leveling a leveling nut on each anchor bolt. Use a washer with each leveling nut. Set the column on the washers without the horizontal structure, and place and tighten a washer and securing nut on each anchor bolt. Tightening is turning the nut an eighth of a turn after the nut is snug tight, and then applying the threadlocker adhesive. After tightening, inspect the connections to ensure full bearing of the top and the bottom washers on the base plate and to ensure that the distance between the top of the stem and the bottom of the base plate does not exceed 4 in. (100 mm). No structure will be accepted if this dimension is greater than 4 in. (100 mm). Attach the horizontal structure to the column with ASTM A 325 (A 325 M) bolts. Install ASTM A 325 (A 325 M) bolts according to Subsection 501.3.04.F, High-Tensile Strength Bolt Connections. Do not reuse bolts and nuts after tightening them.

# D. Type VII Bridge Mounted

Coat with silicone sealant all surfaces that are in contact with concrete. Separate with neoprene or an approved equal material all surfaces that are in contact with dissimilar metals.

# E. Grounding

Install ground rods for each structural support adjacent to the foundation with the conduit as indicated below:

1. Vertically drive single, 8 ft. (2.4 m) long ground rods until the top of the rod is at least 12 in. (300 mm) below the finished ground.
2. Attach a length of #6 bare copper, 7-strand wire to the ground with suitable ground rod clamps and connect it to the grounding nut of the column.
3. If sufficient penetration cannot be obtained in the above manner, place a ground rod system consisting of 3 parallel ground rods a minimum of 6 ft. (1.8 m) center-to-center in a horizontal pattern and at least 12 in. (300 mm) below the finished ground. Join these rods and connect them to the grounding nut of the column with #6 bare copper, 7-strand wire and suitable ground rod clamps.

Section 639 — Strain Poles for Overhead Signs and Signal Assemblies

# A. Steel Strain Poles

Use shafts for steel strain poles fabricated of steel that conforms to one or more of the following:

- ASTM A 242/A 242 M
- ASTM A 709 Grade 50W (A 709 M Grade 345W)
- ASTM A 595
- AISI 1015
- AISI 1020
- SAE: 1015

Ensure that the steel characteristics or strength do not change significantly from welding.

# 1. Shaft

Use the appropriate shape of shaft which is a continuous taper and is constructed of corrosion resistant steel, unless otherwise specified, to the dimensions required for the specified classification type. Form the shaft from one piece with one electrically welded longitudinal joint and no intermediate horizontal joints.

# 2. Pole

Use a pole with a mill certified yield strength of at least 48,000 psi (331 MPa). After forming and welding the pole, the shaft may be longitudinally cold rolled under enough pressure to flatten the shaft to conform to the required yield strength. For Type IV steel strain poles, ensure that the wall thickness is at least 3 gauge or 0.25 in. (6 mm).

# 3. Traffic Signal Strain Poles

Assemble traffic signal strain poles as follows:

- a. Weld a handhole assembly, curved on the front to follow the contour of the pole, into the shaft near the base.
- b. Include a tapped hole on the handhole reinforcing frame to accommodate the grounding lug.
- c. Secure the cover to the frame using at least two screws.
- d. Weld a J-hook wire support inside near the top of the shaft for the poles.
- e. If an overhead power source is shown, use a clamp and clevis device to connect the wire to the pole and provide a weatherproof wire inlet close to the attachment. Conceal the other wiring to and from the controllers within the pole. For traffic signal strain poles with mounted controller cabinets, provide a 2 in. (50 mm) half coupling wire inlet to mount the controller cabinet on the designated pole. Ensure that the location where cable enters the wire inlets at the top of the traffic signal strain poles has a neat design and appearance. Do not use junction boxes at the top of poles to facilitate cable entrances.

# 4. Grounding

Provide a 0.5 in (13 mm) approved grounding connector in the shaft. Equip the top of the shaft with a removable cap held securely in place. Hot-dip galvanize the shaft according to ASTM A 123/A 123 M unless otherwise specified.

# 5. Base

Secure to the lower end of the shaft a one-piece cast steel base or a one-piece flat plate base that meets the requirements of ASTM A 27, Grade 65-35/A27 M Grade 450-240, or A 36/ A 36 M, as required.

- a. Ensure that the base, after welding, develops the full strength of the adjacent shaft section to resist bending.
- b. Attach the base to the concrete foundation with four bolts according to this subsection.
- c. Provide four removable cast or pressed steel ornamental covers with each base and attach it to the base.

Section 639 — Strain Poles for Overhead Signs and Signal Assemblies

6. Anchor Bolts

Furnish each pole with four anchor bolts of the size required in the manufacturer’s Shop Drawings. Ensure that the anchor bolts meet the requirements of Subsection 852.2.02. Galvanize the threaded portions according to ASTM A 153/A 153 M and the Plan details.

# B. Prestressed Concrete Strain Poles

Use shafts for these poles that comply with Subsection 865.2.01.B, except give the poles a steel trowel finish on the unformed side and any required pointing to eliminate air and water holes left by the steel forms. Use Class AAA concrete.

Use a marking tool to identify the pole class and height or cast it with a die in the front face of the pole to produce letters and numbers at least 2 in. (50 mm) high and wide.

# C. Miscellaneous Hardware

Use hardware for steel and concrete strain poles with these features:

# B. Posts and Appurtenances

Follow these steps to install posts and appurtenances:

1. Place and install the posts as shown on the plans. If the soil is Class I, II, III, or V, drive “C” and 2-3/8 in. (60 mm) tube-type line posts for all fence types at least 3 ft. (900 mm) deep instead of using concrete encasement.
2. Encase in concrete line posts installed in marshy or swampy areas (Class IV soils). Install posts in rock according to this subsection.
3. Encase the corner, end, and pull posts in concrete as shown on the plans.
4. Replace posts damaged by driving. When posts are set in concrete, fill the entire hole around the post with Class A or B concrete.
5. Hand mix concrete for batches of 1/2 yd³ (0.5 m³) or less. Firmly brace the posts and hold them in place until the concrete has set.
6. Ensure that the distance between the end, pull, and corner or angle post assemblies does not exceed the following:

| For chain-link fence, straight line | 500 ft. (150 m) |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| For chain-link fence, curved line   | 250 ft. (75 m)  |
| For woven-wire fabric               | 330 ft. (100 m) |
| Field fence                         | 330 ft. (100 m) |

On end, pull, and corner or angle post assemblies for woven-wire fence, add additional approach posts for greater stability when necessary or as directed by the Engineer.
Set posts placed on concrete walls, slabs, or solid rock in round holes 6 in. (150 mm) deep or as indicated on the plans.
Fill the space around the post with molten lead or a cement filler approved by the laboratory.
Repair the posts after cutting or drilling. Repair galvanized steel posts according to Section 645. Repair other metal posts according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Treat timber posts and braces with a preservative coating of the type specified in Subsection 863.2.01.

Section 643 — Fence

# C. Fence Erection

Install fence fabric or barbed wire when posts are set and braced, except when posts are set in concrete footings. When posts are set in concrete footings, delay installing the fabric or wire to allow the concrete to cure at least 5 days. When barbed wire fence is required, install three strands unless otherwise indicated on the plans.

# D. Gates

Ensure that the gate assemblies are the length, height, and type designated on the Plans. Install the gate to provide a 180-degree swing. Weld the gate frames into units. Properly coat them after welding according to Section 894. Stretch fabric that matches the fence fabric taut over the gate frame. Provide gate assemblies with a positive-type locking device, padlock, and keys.

# E. Electrical Ground

Wherever a power line carrying more than 600 volts passes over the fence, install a ground rod.

1. Install the ground rod at the nearest point directly below the point of crossing.
2. Where possible, drive the rod into the ground for a full 8 ft. (2.4 m) of penetration.
1. In rocky soil, drive the rod slanted to provide 18 in. (450 mm) of cover at the tip.
2. In solid rock, install two ground rods at the nearest post on each side of the power line crossing where soil conditions will permit.
3. Use clamps to attach a length of No. 6 AWG bare copper, 7-strand wire between the fence and the ground rod.

# F. Trespassing on Private Property

To trespass on private property outside the right-of-way or easements provided on the plans, obtain permission from the property owner for the intrusion. Use field fence for replacing fence outside the right-of-way or for providing temporary fence at locations shown on the plans or directed by the Engineer. Field fence is considered permanent unless it is specified as temporary.

# G. Maintaining Livestock

Construct the fence to prevent livestock from escaping. Schedule fence removal and new fence installation to provide continuous security of the livestock. If security is not maintained and animals or property are damaged or lost, compensate the owner or make repairs at no cost to the Department. Replace or repair damaged existing fences.

# H. Temporary Barrier Fence

Install the barrier fence according to the manufacturer's instruction. Use suitable strength metal, wood, or composite posts. Ensure the posts are long enough to be embedded to a depth that will provide stability to the fence and have sufficient rigidity to hold the fence in a vertical position. The maximum post spacing is 10 ft. (3 m). Attach the fence to the posts with nails, staples, or wire ties spaced every 6 in. (150 mm) along the posts. Do not allow the method of attachment to create a safety hazard. At the completion of the project, or as directed by the Engineer, remove all barrier fence including posts and incidentals.

# 643.3.06 Quality Acceptance

Repair rusted wire or posts before Final Acceptance or remove and replace with new material at the Contractor’s expense. Do not replace the fence if rusting occurs as a result of ponding water after the fence is erected.

# 643.3.07 Contractor Warranty and Maintenance

# A. Design Criteria and Type Selection

The Impact Attenuator Unit/array Type will be shown on the plans and designated by four characters.

- First character

Indicates the type of permanent installation. The letter "P" designates a permanent (non-gating) installation that is considered reusable. Reusable installations have major components that may be able to survive multiple impacts intact and can be salvaged when the unit is being repaired. Some of the components, however, need to be replaced after a crash to make the entire unit crashworthy again. The letter “S” designates a permanent (non-gating) installation that is considered low-maintenance and/or self-restoring. Low-Maintenance and/or self-restoring installations either suffer very little, if any, damage upon impact and are easily pulled back into their full operating condition, or they partially rebound after an impact and may only need an inspection to ensure that no parts have been damaged or misaligned.
- Second character

Designates the required NCHRP 350 and/or MASH test level.



---

Section 648 — Traffic Impact Attenuator

• Third character

Indicates the traffic flow direction(s). The letter "B" indicates bi-directional traffic typical for median applications or when the unit is installed on the shoulder of a two-lane, two-way traffic facility. Bi-directional means traffic flows in opposite directions at the site of the attenuator installation. The letter "U" indicates uni-directional traffic flow typical for gore areas. Uni-directional means traffic on both sides traveling the same direction, from the nose to the rear of the unit. The letter "S" indicates traffic flow in one direction on a single side only, typical for a unit located on the outside shoulder of a roadway with one-way traffic and the other side of the attenuator not being exposed to traffic.

• Fourth character

Indicates the numerical value of the width, in inches (millimeters), of the base of the rigid object that the attenuator will be shielding. At bridge columns, this character is typically the width of the column plus the barrier base widths on the column sides at the pavement surface.

B. Example

A Type P-3-U-60 attenuator designates a permanent non-gating reusable installation tested and approved at NCHRP 350 and/or MASH test level 3. Uni-directional traffic flow a 60 in. (1500 mm) wide base for the rigid object being shielded. Temporary portable units/arrays may be either gating or non-gating based on construction sequencing and/or field conditions, See Specification Section 150. Unless otherwise specified, all permanent attenuators shall be non-gating.

# 648.3.05 Construction

Field locate the position of the attenuator nose as shown on the plans prior to beginning the installation. Have any variations approved by the Engineer. If the length of the attenuator unit/array is less than that indicated in the plan details for the specified conditions, the length of the concrete transition section or the length of the longitudinal barrier shall be increased as needed to provide a proper beginning point for the attenuator nose as shown in the plans. The length of the system will be the combined length of the attenuator unit/array, the back-up system and any required transition. The length of the system shall not be excessive to the extent that it intrudes appreciably within the clear offset distance as shown on the plans. The increased length of transition or barrier is considered as an incidental part of the system and will not be itemized separately. Temporary portable units/arrays shall be installed, moved, reinstalled and maintained as required.

# 648.3.06 Quality Assurance

Obtain certification from the manufacturer that the impact attenuator unit/array installed meets all required approvals and specifications and furnish these to the Engineer. Furnish any mill test/galvanizing test reports and heat numbers for all metal components of the unit per current requirements of the Department's Office of Materials and Research.

# 651.3.05 Construction

# A. Precasting

1. Concrete
Use concrete materials, and mix and place concrete, to comply with Section 500 for Class A, Air Entrained.
2. Forms
Use forms that meet the requirements of Section 500. Make the insides of forms accessible for tamping and vibrating the concrete.
3. Finish
Unless otherwise specified on the Plans, finish bars according to Subsection 500.3.05.AB. For unformed areas, use Type IV—Floated Surface Finish, unbroomed. For formed areas, use Type I—Ordinary Surface Finish.
4. Curing
Cure bars according to Subsection 500.3.05.Z, except do not use curing compound on the bottom surfaces.

# B. Installation

Follow these steps to cement bars to the pavement:

1. Sandblast clean the highway surface of dirt, curing compound, grease, oil, moisture, loose or unsound layers, and other material that would prevent the bar adhesive from bonding.
2. Use epoxy resin type IR or IS adhesive as follows:
1. Use type IR when pavement temperature is between 50 ° to 60 °F (10 ° to 15 °C), or when traffic conditions require a rapid set.
2. Use type IS when pavement temperatures are above 60 °F (15 °C) and when traffic conditions permit.
3. Do not place bars when pavement temperatures drop below 50 °F (10 °C).
3. Place enough adhesive on the cleaned pavement, or on the bottom of the bar, to completely cover the area of contact with no voids. Allow a slight amount of adhesive to extrude from all sides of the bar after it has been pressed into place.
4. Position the bar and press it firmly into the pavement. Immediately and completely remove excess adhesive around the edge of the bar with a clean, absorbent cloth. Do not use thinners or solvents to remove the adhesive. Protect the bar from impact until the adhesive hardens to the degree designated by the Engineer.

# C. Adhesive Qualities

Do not use a viscous or partially set batch of adhesive that does not extrude from under the bar edges when pressed to the pavement.

Do not heat any adhesive above 120 °F (49 ºC).

Prepare adhesive as follows:

1. Before combining Package A and B, thoroughly stir each package. Reject material that cannot be readily redispersed.
2. After stirring, mix one volume from Package A with one volume from Package B until obtaining a uniform color with no visible streaks of either component.
3. Cement bars in place within 10 minutes of starting to mix the adhesive.
4. To prolong the pot life of the adhesive, either let it cool after mixing the components or spread out a thin layer on a board before applying it.
5. When an approved fast setting adhesive is used, mix the components using a 2-component type automatic mixing and extrusion apparatus. Place the bars immediately after the adhesive has been mixed and extruded.

Section 653 — Thermoplastic Traffic Stripe

# 653.3 Construction Requirements

# 653.3.01 Personnel

General Provisions 101 through 150.

# 653.3.02 Equipment

Depending on the marking required, use hand equipment or truck-mounted application units on roadway installations.

# A. Application Machine

Ensure that each application machine is equipped with the following features:

- Parts continuously mix and agitate the material.
- Truck-mounted units for lane, edge, and center lines operate at a uniform, predetermined rate of speed, both uphill and downhill, in order to produce a uniform application of striping material and capable of following straight lines and making normal curves in a true arc.
- Conveying parts between the main material reservoir and the shaping die or gun prevent accumulation and clogging.
- Parts that contact the material are easily accessible and exposable for cleaning and maintenance.
- Mixing and conveying parts, including the shaping die or gun, maintain the material at the plastic temperature with heat transfer oil or electrical element-controlled heat. Do not use an external source of direct heat.
- Parts provide continuously uniform stripe dimensions.
- Applicator cleanly and squarely cuts off stripe ends and applies skip lines. Do not use pans, aprons, or similar appliances that the die overruns.
- Parts produce varying widths of traffic markings.
- Applicator is mobile and maneuverable enough to follow straight lines and make normal curves in a true arc.

# B. Automatic Bead Dispenser

Apply glass spheres and/or reflective composite optics to the surface of the completed stripe using a dispenser attached to the striping machine to automatically dispense the beads/optics instantaneously upon the installed line. Synchronize the glass sphere/optics dispenser cutoff with the automatic cutoff of the thermoplastic material.

# C. Special Kettles

Use special kettles for melting and heating the thermoplastic material. Use kettles equipped with automatic thermostatic control devices that provides positive temperature control and prevents overheating. Ensure that the applicator and kettles are equipped and arranged according to the requirements of the National Fire Underwriters.

# D. Hand Equipment

Use hand equipment for projects with small quantities of lane lines, edge lines, and center lines, or for conditions requiring the equipment. Use hand equipment approved by the Engineer. Ensure hand equipment can hold 150 lbs. (68 kg) of molten material and is maneuverable to install crosswalks, arrows, legends, lane, edge, and center lines.

# E. Auxiliary Vehicles

Supply the necessary auxiliary vehicles for the operation.

# 653.3.03 Preparation

For asphaltic concrete pavement, do not begin placement of thermoplastic striping until 15 calendar days after completion of the final surface course.

# 653.3.04 Fabrication

General Provisions 101 through 150.

1205

Section 653 — Thermoplastic Traffic Stripe

# 653.3.05 Construction

# A. General Application

Notify the Engineer prior to the placement of the thermoplastic materials. Furnish the Engineer with the manufacturer’s name and batch numbers of the thermoplastic materials and glass spheres to be used. Ensure that the approved batch numbers appear on the thermoplastic materials and glass spheres packages.

Thoroughly clean pavement areas to be striped. Use hand brooms, rotary brooms, air blasts, scrapers, or other approved methods that leave the pavement surface clean and undamaged. Take care to remove all vegetation and road film from the striping area. Ensure all new Portland cement concrete pavement surfaces are mechanically wire brushed or abrasive cleaned to remove all laitance and curing compound before being striped. Lay stripe with continuous uniform dimensions.

Apply the type of stripe at each location according to the Plans, using one of the following methods:

- Spray techniques
- Extrusion methods wherein one side of the shaping die is the pavement and the other three sides are contained by or are part of the suitable equipment to heat and control the flow of material.
- Extrusion methods using a pressurized ribbon gun to control the application of material.

# 1. Temperature

Apply thermoplastic traffic stripe only when the pavement temperature in the shade is above 40 °F (4 °C). To ensure optimum adhesion, install the thermoplastic material in a melted state at the manufacturer’s recommended temperature but not at less than 375 °F (190 °C).

# 2. Moisture

Do not apply when the surface is moist. When directed by the Engineer, perform a moisture test on the Portland cement concrete pavement surface. Perform the test as follows:

1. Place approximately 1 yd² (1m²) of roofing felt on the pavement surface.
2. Pour approximately 1/2 gallon (2 L) of molten thermoplastic onto the roofing felt.
3. After 2 minutes, lift the roofing felt and inspect to see if moisture is present on the pavement surface or underside of the roofing felt.
4. If moisture is present, do not proceed with the striping operation until the surface has dried sufficiently to be moisture free.

# 3. Sealing Primer

To ensure optimum adhesion, apply a binder-sealer material before installing the thermoplastic in each of the following cases:

- Where directed by the Engineer for sprayed thermoplastic
- Old asphaltic concrete pavements with exposed aggregates
- Portland cement concrete pavements
- Bridge Deck Polymer Overlay

Ensure that the binder-sealer material forms a continuous film that mechanically adheres to the pavement and dries rapidly. Use a binder-sealer currently in use and recommended by the thermoplastic material manufacturer according to QPL 46. Apply the binder-sealer immediately in advance of, but concurrent with, the application of the thermoplastic material. Apply in a continuous film over the pavement surface.

# 4. Bonding to Old Stripe

If the old stripe is to be renewed by overlaying with new material, ensure the new material bonds to the old line without splitting or cracking.

# 5. Offset from Construction Joints

Off-set longitudinal lines at least 2 in (50 mm) from construction joints of Portland cement concrete pavements.

# Section 653 — Thermoplastic Traffic Stripe

# 6. Crosswalks, Stop Bars, and Symbols

Make crosswalks, stop bars, and symbols at least 3/32 in (2.4 mm) thick at the edges and no more than 3/16 in (4.8 mm) thick at the center.

# 7. Thickness

a. Maintain the following minimum average dry thicknesses above the surface on all types of pavements:

- 0.090 in. (2.3 mm) * for lane lines
- 0.060 in. (1.5 mm) * for edge lines
- 0.120 in. (3.0 mm) * for gore area lines
- 0.120 in. (3.0 mm) * for polymer overlay edge lines and lane lines

(See below for ‘*’ reference.)

Compute the minimums by the amount of material used each day, as follows:

(For 6 in wide stripe)

* Average Thickness (in) = [(lbs. used) ÷ (total linear feet)] x 0.236

(For 150 mm wide stripe)

* Average Thickness (mm) = [(kg used) ÷ (total linear meters)] x 4.0

(For 10 in wide stripe)

* Average Thickness (in) = [(lbs. used) ÷ (total linear feet)] x 0.118

(For 250 mm wide stripe)

* Average Thickness (mm) = [(kg used) ÷ (total linear meters)] x 2.0

b. Audible Profiled Thermoplastic – Apply a flat edge line having a thickness of 0.100 inches – 0.150 inches (100 mils – 150 mils) above the surface on all types of pavements, exclusive of bumps.

# 8. Glass Spheres and Reflective Composite Optics

a. Apply glass spheres and/or reflective composite optics to installed stripe surface above the minimum rate recommended by the thermoplastic material manufacturer to produce the required retro-reflectivity value in accordance with Subsection 653.3.06.

b. Apply the glass sphere and/or reflective composite optics top-coating with a pressure-type gun specifically designed for applying glass spheres and/or reflective composite optics that will embed at least one-half of the sphere’s and optic’s diameter into the thermoplastic immediately after the material has been applied to the pavement.

c. Audible Profiled Thermoplastic– Apply glass sphere and/or reflective composite optics to all markings at the rates determined by the manufacturer’s recommendations as identified in the APL system.

# 9. Dimensions of Raised Bumps:

a. Apply the raised bumps with a profile such that the leading and trailing edges are sloped at a sufficient angle to create an audible and vibratory warning.

b. Bumps on the edge line and centerline marking shall be at least 0.45 in. (11 mm) at the highest point of the bump, above the pavement surface including the base line. The height measures after the application of the drop-on retroreflective elements or glass spheres.

c. Bumps shall have a minimum baseline coverage dimension of 2.5 in. (65 mm) in both the transverse and longitudinal directions.

d. The bumps may have a drainage channel. The width of each drainage channel will not exceed 0.25 in. (6 mm) at the bottom of the channel. The longitudinal distance between bumps shall be approximately 30 in. (762 mm).

Section 653 — Thermoplastic Traffic Stripe

# B. Removing Existing Stripe

Remove existing stripe according to Section 656.

Remove 100 percent of existing traffic stripe from:

- Portland cement concrete pavement where the new stripe will be placed at the same location as the existing marking
- Pavement where the new stripe will be placed at a different location from the existing markings

# C. Tolerance and Appearance

1. No traffic stripe shall be less than the specified width and shall not exceed the specified width by more than 1/2 in. (13 mm). The length of the 15 ft. (4.5 m) segment for skip stripe and the 25 ft. (7.5 m) gap between segments may vary plus or minus 1 ft. (300 mm). The alignment of the stripe shall not deviate from the intended alignment by more than 1 in. (25 mm) on straight lines. On curves up to and including 1 degree (radius of 1745 m or greater), the alignment of the stripe shall not deviate from the intended alignment by more than 1 in. (25 mm). On curves exceeding 1 degree (radius less than 1745 m), the alignment of the stripe shall not deviate from the intended alignment by more than 2 in. (50 mm).
2. Stop work when deviation exceeds the above dimensions and remove the nonconforming stripe.
3. No more than 1 percent of the bumps or more than three consecutive bumps are missing or broken (less than half a bump remaining) within the first 45 days under traffic, replace all failed bumps at no cost to the Department.
4. If the bumps are replaced and more than 2 percent of the replaced bumps fail within the first 45 days under traffic, the replacement period will be extended an additional 45 days from the date all replacement bumps were installed.
5. If at the end of the additional 45 days more than 2 percent of all bumps (initial and replacement) fail, replace all failed bumps at no expense to the Department.

# D. Traffic Marking Protection (Audible Profile Thermoplastic)

Thickness measurement may be performed using a strong adhesive tape to install a metal plate (approximately 6 inches (150 mm) wide by 8 inches (200 mm) long, the thickness of the plate can by 1/8 inch (3 mm) as long as the plate does not deform) to the roadway where the pavement marking will be placed. After the material has dried remove the plate and check the thickness of the pavement marking material on the plate with a micrometer.

E. Corrective Work

For each mile (1600 m) section, if the thermoplastic traffic stripe fails to meet Plan details or specifications or deviates from stated dimensions, correct it at no additional cost to the Department. If removal of pavement markings is necessary, perform it according to Section 656 and place it according to this specification. No additional payment will be made for removal and replacement of unsatisfactory striping. Ensure corrective work is completed at no additional cost to the Department. Perform testing according to this specification. Any retest due to failures will be performed at no additional cost to the Department. Furnish all test reports to the Department. Retro-reflectivity and Thickness Longitudinal Line Deficiency: A deficiency will ensue when two or more Location Average results as recorded on form OMR CVP 66 within a One-Mile (1600 m) Section do not meet the performance criteria herein. The entire line within this one-mile (1600 m) section will be determined to be deficient. If the evaluated section is less than 1.0 mile (1600 m), a single Location Average result not meeting the performance criteria herein will result in the entire line to be determined to be deficient. Retro-reflectivity Transverse Markings and Symbol Deficiency: A single Location Average result on the marking or symbol not meeting the performance criteria herein will result in the marking or symbol to be determined to be deficient.

# A. Adhesive Types

Cement markers to pavement surfaces with a Type I-R Epoxy or Type I-S Epoxy (see Section 886), or with a bituminous adhesive (see Section 868). Space markers according to the plans.

1. Type I-R Epoxy. Use Type I-R Epoxy when the pavement temperature is above 50 °F (10 °C), or when traffic conditions require a rapid setting system.
2. Type I-S Epoxy. Use Type I-S Epoxy when the pavement temperature is above 60 °F (15 °C) and traffic conditions permit a slower setting system.
3. Bituminous Adhesive. Use bituminous adhesive when the pavement temperature is above 40 °F (4 °C) or when traffic conditions require a rapid setting material.

# B. Handling and Applying Adhesives

Obtain an epoxy adhesive furnished as two separate components. Combine and use the components as follows:

1. Immediately before use, thoroughly stir the individual components with separate paddles. Reject material permanently increasing in viscosity or showing settling of pigments, filler, or thixotropic additives that cannot be readily redispersed.
2. After stirring or agitating the two separate components, mix them in a one-to-one ratio and blend thoroughly until obtaining a uniform color without streaks.
3. At time of mixing, ensure that the temperature of both components is 60 ° to 80 °F (15 ° to 27 °C). If necessary, heat components using indirect heat to avoid locally overheating and decomposing the material. Do not heat adhesive above 120 °F (49 °C).

1213

Section 654 — Raised Pavement Markers

4. Place markers between the start of mixing the epoxy system and the termination of the pot life. The Engineer will designate the allowable pot life based on environmental factors. Never use a partially set mixed system that does not readily extrude around the perimeter of the marker when pressed to the roadway.

5. When using an approved fast-setting epoxy system, mix the separate components with a two-component type automatic mixing and extrusion apparatus, and place markers immediately.

6. Use bituminous adhesive furnished in approximately 30 lb. (14 kg) cubes.

- a. Heat the cubes in an oil-jacketed melting pot.
- b. Maintain the bituminous adhesive at the manufacturer-recommended temperature during placement of the markers.
- c. Discard bituminous adhesive heated above 450 °F (232 °C).

# 661.3 Construction Requirements

# 661.3.01 Equipment

# A. Traveling Traffic Striping Machine

To apply the traffic marking material, use a mobile, truck mounted and self contained pavement marking machine, specifically designed to apply two-component liquid materials, and glass beads, in a continuous and skip-line pattern.

Apply the two-component liquid materials through airless impingement mixing guns or static mix tubes. The guns must accommodate a plural component material system at the manufacturer’s recommended volumetric mixing ratio. The guns must have the capacity to deliver materials from approximately 1.5 gal (5.7 L) to 3 gal (11.4 L) per minute to compensate for a typical range of application speeds of 3 mph (5 km/h) to 6 mph (10 km/h). Ensure that the machine travels at a uniform rate of speed both uphill and downhill.

Select the necessary accessories such as spray tip, mix chamber or static tube, and rod diameter to ensure proper mixing.

Ensure that the machine meets the following:

- The machine is capable of applying three separate stripes, either solid or skip, in any specified pattern by utilizing two adjacent spray nozzles at the same time.
- Each nozzle is equipped with satisfactory cutoff valves that will apply skip lines automatically.
- The application equipment is maneuverable to the extent that straight lines can be followed and normal curves can be made in a true arc.
- The truck-mounted unit is provided with accessories to allow for the marking of symbols and legends.

Ensure that the mobile applicator also includes the following features:

- The mobile applicator provides individual material reservoirs for the storage of Part A and Part B of the resin composition.
- The applicator is equipped with glass spheres dispensing equipment and capable of applying the glass spheres at a uniform rate.
- The application equipment is equipped with metering devices or pressure gauges on the proportioning pumps as well as stroke counters to monitor volumetric usage. Ensure that the metering devices or pressure gauges and stroke counters are visible.
- The applicator is equipped with all the necessary spray equipment, mixers, compressors, and other appurtenances to allow for the placement of reflectorized pavement markings in a simultaneous sequence of operations.

# B. Hand Equipment

Use hand equipment for projects with small quantities of bike lanes, lane lines, edge lines, and center lines, or for conditions that require the equipment. Use hand equipment approved by the Engineer.

---

Section 661 — Standard and Wet Weather Epoxy Traffic Stripe

# C. Cleaning Equipment

Use brushes, brooms, scrapers, grinders, high-pressure water jets, or air blasters to remove dirt, dust, grease, oil, and other foreign matter without damaging the underlying pavement.

# 661.3.02 Preparation

Notify the Engineer prior to the placement of the epoxy materials. Furnish the Engineer with the manufacturer’s name and batch numbers of the epoxy materials and glass spheres to be used. Ensure that the approved batch numbers appear on the epoxy materials and glass spheres packages.

Before striping, thoroughly clean pavement surfaces of dust, dirt, grease, oil, and all other foreign matter. Remove concrete curing compounds on new Portland cement concrete surfaces and existing pavement markings on both concrete and asphalt surfaces.

# 661.3.03 Construction

# A. Atmospheric Conditions

1. Apply pavement markings only during conditions of dry weather and subsequently dry pavement surfaces. Ensure that the pavement surface temperature and the ambient temperature at the time of installation are both greater than 40 ºF (4 ºC) and that the relative humidity is not greater than 85%.
2. Moisture
1. Do not apply when the surface is moist. When directed by the Engineer, perform a moisture test on the Portland cement concrete pavement surface. Perform the test as follows:
1. Place approximately 1 yd² (1m²) of roofing felt on the pavement surface.
2. Pour approximately 1/2 gallon (2 L) of mixed epoxy onto the roofing felt.
3. After 2 minutes, lift the roofing felt and inspect to see if moisture is present on the pavement surface or underside of the roofing felt.
4. If moisture is present, do not proceed with the striping operation until the surface has dried sufficiently to be moisture free.

# B. Alignment

Ensure that the traffic stripe is the specified length, width, and placement. On sections where no previously applied markings are present, ensure accurate stripe location by establishing control points at spaced intervals. The Engineer will approve control points.

# C. Application

Apply the pavement markings as follows:

1. Apply the liquid marking material by spray method and according to the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
2. Ensure marking configurations are in accordance with the “Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.”
3. Place the reflectorized pavement markings only on properly prepared surfaces and at the widths and patterns designated on the Plans. Do not begin marking operations until applicable surface preparation work is completed and approved by the Engineer.
4. Air-blast the surface first, to remove any dirt and residues from the pavement. Then apply the pavement markings as a continuous operation.
5. Ensure that mixing of the two components occurs in a static tube or impingement chamber prior to reaching the application spray nozzle.
6. Spray the mixed resin onto the pavement at a rate to obtain a minimum uniform dry thickness of 25 mils ± 2 mils (0.635 mm ± 0.051 mm) above the surface of the pavement on open graded asphalt concrete friction courses and 20 mils ± 2 mils (0.508 mm ± 0.051 mm) above the surface of the pavement on all other pavement types.

- b. Apply the glass sphere and/or reflective composite optics top-coating with a pressure-type gun specifically designed for applying glass spheres and/or reflective composite optics that will embed at least one-half of the sphere’s and optic’s diameter into the epoxy immediately after the material has been applied to the pavement.
- c. Do not apply glass spheres or reflective composite optics to bike lanes. Following an application of glass spheres and/or reflective composite optics, and upon curing, ensure that the resulting marking is an adherent reflectorized stripe of the specified thickness and width that is capable of resisting deformation by traffic.

D. Protective Measures

Protect newly applied striping as follows:

1. Traffic
- Control and protect traffic with warning and directional signs during application. Set up warning signs before beginning each operation and place signs well ahead of the equipment. When necessary, use a pilot car to protect both the traffic and the striping operation.
2. Fresh Striping
- Protect the freshly applied stripe using cones or other satisfactory devices. Repair stripe damage or pavement smudges caused by traffic according to Subsection 661.3.04.

E. Appearance and Tolerance of Variance

Continually deviating from stated dimensions is cause for stopping the work and removing the nonconforming stripe. (See Section 656.) Adhere to the following measurements:

1. Width
- Do not lay stripe less than the specified width. Do not lay stripe more than 1/2 in. (13 mm) over the specified width.
2. Length
- Ensure that the 10 ft. (3 m) skip stripe and the 30 ft. (10 m) gap between skip segments vary no more than ± 1 ft. (300 mm) each.
3. Alignment
- a. Ensure that the stripe does not deviate from the intended alignment by more than 1 in. (25 m) on straight lines or curves of 1 degree or less.
- b. Ensure that the stripe does not deviate by more than 2 in. (50 mm) on curves exceeding 1 degree.

# 661.3.04 Quality Acceptance

A. General

For a minimum of 30 days from the time of placement, ensure the epoxy traffic pavement marking material shows no signs of failure due to blistering, excessive cracking, chipping, bleeding, staining, discoloration, oil content of the pavement materials, smearing or spreading under heat, deterioration due to contact with grease deposits, oil, diesel fuel, or gasoline drippings, spilling, poor adhesion to the pavement material, vehicular damage, and normal wear. In the event that failures mentioned above occur, ensure corrective work is completed at no additional cost to the Department.

Ensure that stripes and segments of stripes are clean-cut and uniform. Markings that do not appear uniform or satisfactory, either during the day or night, or do not meet specifications or become marred or damaged by traffic or from other causes, will be corrected at the Contractor’s expense.

- A. Drain Fabrication
Ensure the following:

- Use drainage wicks consisting of a band–shaped plastic case, permitting continuous vertical drainage, wrapped in a filter jacket, installed in the ground by displacement methods, and spaced and arranged as shown on the plans. Ensure drainage wicks are a prefabricated type consisting of a plastic drainage core encased in or integrated with a nonwoven polyester filter jacket. Use a band-shaped drain with an aspect ratio (width divided by thickness) not exceeding 50. Ensure the jacket allows free passage of pore water to the core without loss of soil material or piping. Ensure the core provides continuous vertical drainage.
- Ensure the assembled drains are resistant to wet rot, mildew, bacterial action, insects, salts, acids, alkalis, solvents, or any other ingredients in the site groundwater harmful to the drains. Use drains free from defects, rips, holes or flaws.
- Ensure the filter jacket is capable of resisting all bending, puncturing, and tensile forces imposed during installation and during the design life of the drain. Use a jacket material resistant to localized damage (e.g., punching through the filter by sand or gravel particles) and sufficiently rigid to withstand lateral earth pressures due to embedment and surcharge so the vertical flow capacity through the core will not be adversely affected.

Section 682 — Electrical Wire, Cable, And Conduit

# C. Testing Conductors

Caution: There is a risk of electrical shock when performing this test. This test should only be performed by qualified personnel that have electrical testing safety training compliant with or equivalent to ANSI/NETA ETT, Standard for Certification of Electrical Testing Technicians.

Even though insulation is a dielectric material there will be very small amounts of current that leak through it. The amount of current that leaks depends on the strength of the insulation, its moisture content, and its temperature. Measurements should be taken when the relative humidity is below 50% and the electrical system temperature is below 86°F (30°C), but above the dew point temperature. During each one (1) minute test, if the resistance value decreases it is likely that the conductor or cable is wet or contaminated. The conductors can be dried by passing compressed dry nitrogen through the cable or conduit. If this fails, the system should be evaluated for contamination.

Inspect all insulation for signs of contamination, degradation, and mechanical damage or abrasion. Any defective cable shall be replaced at no additional cost to the Department.

Prior to connecting service to the newly installed system test the insulation resistance per the following procedure:

Before beginning the test, make sure that the following precautions are observed:

1. The cable or wiring assembly should be disconnected from the system and NOT energized.
2. Set or hang the meter. Do not hold the meter in hands in case of transient voltages.
3. Discharge any conductor capacitance before and after each test.
4. Wear insulating rubber gloves when connecting or disconnecting test leads.
5. Don’t use an insulation tester near explosive agents.
6. Follow all of the meter manufacturer’s safety precautions.

The test meter manufacturer will provide the meter connection instructions as well as instructions for operation of the meter.

The following tests must be conducted, and the listed data below recorded on the test form (or Engineer approved equivalent) which must be completed and submitted to the Engineer for approval. Use multiple copies as required.

Using the Step Voltage Test method to measure the insulation resistance, each branch circuit must be tested from the service cabinet through the end of the branch circuit to include all contractor installed conductors and splices within the circuit, all in accordance with the meter manufacturer’s instructions. Perform insulation resistance test on each conductor with respect to ground and adjacent conductors and measure insulation resistance of each bus way or conduit assembly, phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground.

Record all relevant data using the format in the table below. Be sure to discharge any line capacitance after each test.

1. Apply 250V DC, test duration shall be one (1) minute and measure resistance and record the required information.
2. Apply 500V DC, test duration shall be one (1) minute and measure resistance and record the required information.

Insulation resistance values shall be within 5 percent of manufacturer’s published data. If the manufacturer’s published data is not available, the measured insulation resistance shall be 100 meg-ohms or greater. Values of insulation resistance less than this or the manufacturer’s recommendations shall be investigated. In the event of failure, individual conductor runs between poles and/or splice locations should be tested to determine the problem and resolve it. The system’s minimum insulation resistance should be 25 meg-ohms.

For native restoration and riparian mitigation seed mix combinations, use Table 4 for approved native herbaceous seed types in combination with Table 3 of native grass seeds. Native restoration and riparian seed mixes should incorporate a mix of 60% native grass types (see Table 3) and 40% native herbaceous types (see Table 4) applied at a minimum rate total of 10 (11) lbs. per acre (kg/hectare) for each combined mix.

# TABLE 5: TEMPORARY GRASS - SPECIES, SEEDING RATES AND PLANTING DATES

When stage construction or other conditions prevent completing a roadway section continuously, apply temporary grassing to control erosion. Temporary grassing is used to stabilize disturbed areas for more than sixty (60) calendar days. Temporary grass may be applied any time of the year, utilizing the appropriate seed species and application rate as shown in the chart above. Apply mulch to areas planted in temporary grass at the rate of ¾ inch to 1.5 inches. Do not place slope mats on areas planted in temporary grass.

Section 700 — Grassing

# A. Ground Preparation

Prepare the ground by plowing under any temporary grass areas and preparing the soil as follows:

1. Slopes 3:1 or Flatter
On slopes 3:1 or flatter, plow shoulders and embankment slopes to between 4 in. and 6 in. (100 mm and 150 mm) deep. Plow front and back slopes in cuts to no less than 6 in. (150 mm) deep. After plowing, thoroughly disk the area until pulverized to the plowed depth.
2. Slopes Steeper Than 3:1
Serrate slopes steeper than 3:1 according to plan details when required. On embankment slopes and cut slopes not requiring serration (sufficient as determined by the Engineer), prepare the ground to develop an adequate seed bed using any of the following methods as directed by the Engineer:

- Plow to a depth whatever depth is practicable.
- Use a spiked chain.
- Walk with a cleated track dozer.
- Scarify.

Disking cut slopes and fill slopes is not required.
3. All Slopes
1. Obstructions
Remove boulders, stumps, large roots, large clods, and other objects that interfere with grassing or may slide into the ditch.
2. Topsoil
Spread topsoil stockpiled during grading evenly over cut and fill slopes after preparing the ground. Push topsoil from the top over serrated slopes. Do not operate equipment on the face of completed serrated cuts.
4. Native Restoration Areas, Riparian Areas, Stream Restoration Areas, and Wetland and Stream Mitigation Areas.
For Permanent Grassing in native restoration areas, multitrophic native planting areas, riparian areas, stream restoration areas, and wetland and stream mitigation areas, provide the minimum ground preparation necessary to provide seed to soil contact. Riparian areas may also be seeded using the no-till method. The no-till method is defined by planting permanent grass seeds using a drill-type seeder over existing vegetation without plowing or tilling soil. Ensure that existing vegetation is less than 3 inches in height (this may be achieved by mowing or using a mechanical string trimmer).

D. Applying Agricultural Lime and Fertilizer Mixed Grade

Apply and mix lime and fertilizer as follows:

1. Agricultural Lime
Uniformly spread agricultural lime on the ground at the approximate rate determined by the laboratory soil test.

- Agricultural Lime may be used as filler material in mixed grade fertilizer in lieu of inert material. The use of agricultural lime as filler material is to be shown on the fertilizer bag or invoice from the supplier. Do not deduct any amount of fertilizer when lime is used as filler.
2. Fertilizer Mixed Grade
Uniformly spread the fertilizer selected according to Subsection 700.2.D over the ground or by use of hydroseeding. For bid purposes base estimated quantities on an initial application of 400 lb./acre of 19-19-19.
3. Mixing
Before proceeding, uniformly work the lime and fertilizer into the top 4 in. (100 mm) of soil using harrows, rotary tillers, or other equipment acceptable to the Engineer. On cut slopes steeper than 3:1, other than serrated slopes, reduce the mixing depth to the maximum practical depth as determined by the Engineer. Omit mixing on serrated slopes.
4. Native Restoration Areas, Multitropic Native Planting Areas, Riparian Areas, Stream Restoration Areas, and Wetland and Stream Mitigation Areas
Omit the application of lime and fertilizer within riparian areas.

E. Seeding

Prepare seed and sow as follows:

1. Inoculation of Seed
Inoculate each kind of leguminous seed separately with the appropriate commercial culture according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the culture. When hydroseeding, double the inoculation rate. Protect inoculated seed from the sun and plant it the same day it is inoculated.
2. Sowing
Weather permitting, sow seed within 24 hours after preparing the seed bed and applying the fertilizer and lime. Sow seed uniformly at the rates specified in the seeding tables. Use approved mechanical seed drills, rotary hand seeders, hydroseeding equipment, or other equipment to uniformly apply the seed. Do not distribute by hand. To distribute the seeds evenly sow seed types separately, except for similarly sized and weighted seeds. They may be mixed and sown together. Do not sow during windy weather, when the prepared surface is crusted, or when the ground is frozen, wet, or otherwise non-tillable.
3. Overseeding
Temporary grass areas that were prepared in accordance with Subsection 700.3.05.A, may be overseeded using the no-till method. The no-till method is defined by planting permanent grass seeds using a drill-type seeder over existing temporary grass without plowing or tilling soil and in accordance with Subsection 700.3.05.C.
4. Riparian Seed Mix
Riparian Seed Mix shall be used when specified in the plans. A mix of at least three (3) species from Seeding Table 3 (Native Grasses) and at least two (2) species from Seeding Table 4 (Approved Riparian Mitigation - Herbaceous Plants). The seed shall be applied as Permanent Grassing within those areas designated on the plans. The kinds of seed shall be used according to the appropriate Planting Dates given in the tables.

Section 700 — Grassing

# F. Hydroseeding

Hydroseeding may be used on any grassing area. Under this method, spread the seed, fertilizer, and wood fiber mulch in the form of a slurry. Seeds of all sizes may be mixed together. Apply hydroseeding as follows:

1. Use wood fiber mulch as a metering agent and seed bed regardless of which mulching method is chosen. Apply wood fiber mulch at approximately 500 lbs./acre (560 kg/ha).
2. Prepare the ground for hydroseeding as for conventional seeding in Subsection 700.3.05.A.
3. Use specially designed equipment to mix and apply the slurry uniformly over the entire seeding area.
4. Agitate the slurry mixture during application.
5. Discharge slurry within one hour after being combined in the hydroseeder. Do not hydroseed when winds prevent an even application.
6. Closely follow the equipment manufacturer’s directions unless the Engineer modifies the application methods.
7. Mulch the entire hydroseeded area according to Subsection 700.3.05.F.1, above, and Subsection 700.3.05.G, below. Native Restoration Areas, Multitropic Native Planting Areas, Riparian Areas, Stream Restoration Areas, and Wetland and Stream Mitigation Areas may be hydroseeded. When hydroseeding in these areas only use water, seed and wood fiber mulch.

# G. Mulching

Except as noted in Subsection 700.3.05.B and Subsection 700.3.05.C, apply mulch immediately after seeding areas as follows:

Areas with permanent grass seed and covered with slope mats or blankets will not require mulch. Evenly apply straw or hay mulch between 3/4 in. and 1-1/2 in. (20 mm and 40 mm) deep, according to the texture and moisture content of the mulch material. Mulch shall allow sunlight to penetrate and air to circulate as well as shade the ground, reduce erosion, and conserve soil moisture. If the type of mulch is not specified on the plans or in the Proposal, use any of the following as specified.

1. Mulch with Tackifier
1. Apply mulch with tackifier regardless of whether using ground or hydroseeding equipment for seeding.
1. Mulch uniformly applied manually or with special blower equipment designed for the purpose. When using a blower, thoroughly loosen baled material before feeding it into the machine so that it is broken up.
2. After distributing the mulch initially, redistribute it to bare or inadequately covered areas in clumps dense enough to prevent new grass from emerging (if required). Do not apply mulch on windy days.
3. Apply enough tackifier to the mulch to hold it in place. Immediately replace mulch that blows away. If distributing the mulch by hand, immediately apply the tackifier uniformly over the mulched areas.
- Tackifier: Use a tackifier listed in the Laboratory Qualified Products Manual and apply at the manufacturer’s recommended rates.
2. Walked-in-Mulch
1. Apply walked-in-mulch on slopes ranging in steepness from 5:1 to 2:1 and treat as follows:
1. Immediately walk it into the soil with a cleated track dozer. Make dozer passes vertically up and down the slope.
2. Where walked-in-mulch is used, do not roll or cover the seeds as specified in Subsection 700.3.05.E.3.
3. Apply only wheat straw mulch on Riparian Areas, Stream Restoration Areas, and Wetland and Stream Mitigation Areas after they have been seeded. The wheat straw mulch is to be applied with a maximum thickness of 1 in.

1. Anchor the mesh in a 6 in. (150 mm) deep trench adjacent to the structure.
2. Roll the mesh upstream and use a junction slot to connect it to the mesh that has been rolled downstream.
2. Overlap adjacent strips by at least 6 in. (150 mm).
3. Overlap adjoining ends by at least 6 in. (150 mm).
4. For all overlaps, place the upstream section on top.
5. Use a Type 2 check slot at the downstream end of the jute mesh that does not connect to a structure.
6. Apply jute mesh without stretching. Lay it evenly but loosely on the soil surface.
7. To keep the area smooth, do not allow workers to walk directly on the seedbed before or after applying mesh.
8. Bury the up-channel end of each installation in a narrow, 6 in. (150 mm) deep trench.
9. After burying the mesh, backfill, tamp, and staple the trench as shown on the Plans.
10. Where one roll of jute mesh ends and a second begins, use a junction slot to make the connection as shown on the plans.
11. Space between the check or anchor slots is no more than 50 ft. (15 m) on grades of 3 percent or less. On grades of more than 3 percent, ensure that the space between the check or anchor slots is no more than 25 ft. (7.5 m).

# B. Stapling

Hold matting strips firmly in place with one row of staples as follows:

1. Staple along each edge.
2. Staple each row along the middle.
3. Space staples no more than 3 ft. (1 m) apart in each row.
4. Space the staples in the middle row alternately with those at the edges.
5. For strips wider than 60 in. (1.5 m), space staples no more than 3 ft. (1 m) apart.
6. At the ends of the covered area and at overlapping joints, space staples no more than 18 in. (450 mm) apart.
7. Ensure that staples remain flush with the ground.

# C. Rolling

After placing and stapling the jute mesh:

1. Firmly embed it in the soil by tamping or rolling.
2. Secure mesh that bridges over soil surface irregularities with extra staples to provide overall contact with the soil.

Section 800 — Coarse Aggregate

# 2. Coarse Aggregate Groups

- a. Group I: Limestone, dolomite, marble, or any combination thereof. Ensure Group I aggregates meet the abrasion requirement for Class A stone when used in Portland cement concrete of any type or class.
- b. Group II: Slag, gravel, granitic and gneissic rocks, quartzite, synthetic aggregate, or any combination thereof.

# 3. Classes

Aggregates are classified by physical properties that determine how they are used.

- a. Do not blend aggregates that meet abrasion requirements with aggregates that do not meet requirements from different sources as listed on the Qualified Products List.
- b. “Class A” and “Class B” aggregate used in Portland cement concrete, asphaltic concrete, and bituminous surface treatment shall meet these limits:

|                     | Class A | Class B |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Group I Aggregates  | 0-40    | 41-55   |
| Group II Aggregates | 0-50    | 51-60   |

- c. “Class B” aggregates used in all applications other than Portland cement concrete, asphaltic concrete, or bituminous surface treatment shall meet these limits:

|                     | Class B |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| Group I Aggregates  | 41-55   |
| Group II Aggregates | 51-65   |

# 4. Soundness

Test coarse aggregate used in Portland cement concrete, bituminous surfaces, bituminous bases, aggregate bases, or surface treatment with five alternations of the magnesium sulfate soundness test.

- a. Use aggregate with a weight loss of less than 15 percent.
- b. The 15 percent soundness loss for a Class “CS” concrete is waived if it has a 5-year service record.
- c. If the material meets all the requirements except for the 15 percent soundness requirement, the material may be used in Zones 3 and 4 (see Subsection 424.3.05, Construction Requirements) under the following conditions:
- 1) The aggregate in bituminous courses and in all types and classes of Portland cement concrete construction, except as stated in Group I, has a satisfactory five-year service record under similar service and exposure.
- 2) The Engineer’s investigation shows that it equals or exceeds the quality of approved aggregate (in cases where the material’s uniformity changes at the source or does not have a five-year service record).

# 5. Grades

Use coarse aggregate that is well graded within the limits and sizes specified in Table 800.1.

Section 800 — Coarse Aggregate

# 6. Detrimental Substances

a. Detrimental substances include shale, weathered or decomposed rock, friable particles, or any substance that may be detrimental for the use intended.

b. Do not use any aggregate that can cause a deleterious reaction.

c. Do not use aggregates that contain Chrysotile (defined as fibrous serpentinite) as a temporary or permanent unbound surfacing for roads, nor as stabilizer for soil used as subgrade, base, or surface course.

d. Detrimental substances shall not exceed the following limits:

---

Section 809 — Geogrid Materials

Submit product specifications and test results to the Engineer for review and approval at least 45 days prior to intended use. Do not begin placement of geogrid until the test results have been reviewed and approved by the Engineer.

# 809.2 Materials

# A. Requirements

Use geogrid that is free of defects, punctures or flaws.

# 1. Geogrid for Reinforced Slopes

Use geogrid materials for reinforced slope construction that consist of the following:

- Either a biaxial or uniaxial grid of polymer tensile elements manufactured into a regular network with apertures of sufficient size to allow for soil interlock.
- A commercially prepared material of high tenacity polyester, high density polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene that is formed by stretching, heat welding, chemical welding, knitting, weaving or combinations of these methods.

Adhere to the following additional requirements:

# Long Term Design Strengths

1. Use geogrid that meets the minimum long-term design strengths (TLT) in the machine direction as indicated on the plans.
2. Provide to the Engineer, in writing, the ultimate tensile strength of the grid (TULT) to verify the calculation in obtaining the long-term design loads (TLT). These strengths are required for the Project and are determined based on the AASHTO Task Force 27 guidelines, which incorporates reduction factors to the ultimate strength of the geogrid for creep, site damage and durability.
3. Calculate the long-term design strength using the following formula:

TLT = TULT x CRC
FC x FD

Where:

- TLT = Long-term design load—lb/ft (kg/m)
- TULT = Geogrid ultimate tensile strength—lb./ft. (kg/m)
- CRC = Creep reduction coefficient
- FC = Factor of safety to account for construction damage
- FD = Factor of safety to account for product durability

# a. Determine TULT

Determine the TULT based on wide strip tensile testing as noted in Subsection 809.2.02.

# b. Determine Reduction Factors

Determine the reduction factors by the methods described in paragraphs a - e as follows:

1. Creep
1. Provide evidence from the manufacturer that the geogrid has been tested in laboratory creep tests according to the following criteria:
- Conducted for a minimum duration of 10,000 hours
- Tests were made for a range of load levels, including loads that the geogrid will be subjected to on the project.
2. Ensure these tests are conducted as specified in Subsection 809.2.02.
3. Extrapolate the results extrapolated to a minimum design life of 75 years.

1468

---

Section 809 — Geogrid Materials

d) Determine the tension level at which the total strain of the geogrid is not expected to exceed 10% within the design life of 75 years (designated Tw).

e) Calculate the creep reduction factor as follows:

CRC = Tw / TULT

In the absence of test data, use the following creep reduction factors for different polymers:

| Polymer Type  | Creep Reduction Coefficient |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Polyester     | 0.40                        |
| Polypropylene | 0.20                        |
| Polyamide     | 0.35                        |
| Polyethylene  | 0.20                        |

# 2) Construction Damage

a) Provide evidence from the manufacturer that the geogrid has been subjected to full scale construction damage tests using fill materials and construction procedures which are representative of those on the project.

b) Excavate and test the grid according to Subsection 809.2.02.

c) Calculate the construction damage factor of safety using the following formula:

FC = TULT / TC

Where:

- FC = The construction damage factor
- TC = The ultimate strength of the excavated grid that has been subjected to construction damage tests.
- TULT = Geogrid ultimate tensile strength—lb/ft (kg/m)

d) If construction damage tests have been made, but with fills or construction procedures other than those represented on the Project, use a minimum value of FC of 1.25. Use a lower value of FC only if substantiated with damage tests using fills and construction procedures specific to the project.

e) In the absence of any construction damage tests, use a FC value of 3.0.

# 3) Product Durability

a) Provide evidence from the manufacturer that the geogrid has been subjected to a series of durability tests to examine the effects of chemical and biological exposure on the grid, as described in the AASHTO Task Force 27 report.

b) Include the following in the durability studies:

- Effect on short-term and long-term mechanical properties.
- Changes to the following:

Section 809 — Geogrid Materials

• Temperature

• Plasticization

• Surface micrology

• Variations in the infrared spectrum analysis.

A full investigation into the synergetic effects of different environments, particularly temperature. Subject the reinforcement to a working stress during the environmental test.

1. Ensure that geogrid used in the Work has been subjected to the environmental conditioning as outlined by the following, as a minimum:
2. - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Method 9090 – Chemical Compatibility.
- Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, Method 30 – Soil Burial.
- American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, Method 100 – Preparation of Bacterial Broth.

Investigate the full range of soil environments to which the reinforcements may be potentially exposed and shall include as a minimum:

In the performance of this testing the conditioning temperature is laboratory standard plus 1.5 times laboratory standard for the pH environments. When no conditioning time period is given, use 30 days. Extrapolate results from short-term tests to the required design life of 75 years.

After the geogrid is subjected to these conditions, test the geogrid according to Subsection 809.2.02, and calculate the durability factor of safety by the following formula:

FD = TULT / TD

Where: TD = The ultimate strength of the geogrid subjected to product durability tests. The minimum allowable value of FD is 1.10. In the absence of any geogrid durability tests, use a Durability Factor (FD) of 2.0.

# 4) Pullout Resistance:

1. Provide evidence from the manufacturer that the geogrid has been subjected to full-scale pullout tests using backfill materials representative of those on the Project, as described in the AASHTO Task Force 27 report.
2. Base pullout resistance for design on a maximum of elongation of the embedded geogrid of ¾ in. (19 mm) as measured at the leading edge of the compressive zone within the soil mass and not the ultimate pullout capacity.
3. Where insufficient data exists to evaluate the pullout resistance of geogrid as a function of soil type, conduct pullout tests on a project specific basis until the engineering behavior of the soil-reinforcement system is clearly defined.
4. Perform pullout using vertical stress variations (Sv) and reinforcement element configurations simulating actual project conditions.

# Section 809 — Geogrid Materials

e) Perform pullout tests according to Subsection 809.2.02 on samples with a minimum embedded length of 2 ft. (600 mm). Perform the tests on samples with a minimum width of 1 ft. (300 mm), or a width equal to a 4 longitudinal grid element, whichever is greater. Conduct the tests at 70 oF ±4 oF (21ºC ± 2 °C) at constant strain rates of 0.02 in. (0.5mm) per minute.

Evaluate the pullout resistance by the following relation:

Tp = (2 tan P) x Sv x Ls x fd

Where:

- Tp = Ultimate pullout capacity of tensile reinforcement—lb./ft. (kg/m)
- Sv = Vertical stress—lb./ ft.² (kg/m²)
- Ls = Total length of geogrid beyond failure plane—ft. (m)
- P = Internal angle of friction of select backfill
- fd = Equivalent coefficient of direct sliding derived from pullout tests

The equivalent coefficient of direct sliding, fd, may be related to the open area of the grid. In the absence of product specific data tested with site-specific granular backfill, estimate the from the following preliminary analysis:

| % Open Area of Grid | Direct Sliding |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| 80% more            | 0.5            |
| 51 to 79            | 0.7            |
| 50 or less          | 0.6            |

Ensure the pullout resistance, Tp, meets the following minimum strength requirement:

Tp = FPO x TLT with a displacement less than or equal to ¾ in. (19 mm)

Where:

- FPO = Factor of safety against pullout, equal to 1.5
- TLT = Long-term design load—lb./ft. (kg/m)

Section 809 — Geogrid Materials

5) Junction Strength:

- a) Ensure that the summation of the shear strength of the joints occurring in a 12 in. (300 mm) length of the grid sample is greater than the ultimate tensile strength of the element to which they are attached.
- b) If this condition is not met, reduce the allowable reinforcement tension, Tw, by the ratio of the shear strengths to the ultimate strength.
- c) Determine the ultimate tensile strength according to Subsection 809.2.02 and translate it into an ultimate strength per element by dividing the number of elements per foot (meter) of width.
- d) Measure the junction strength according to Subsection 809.2.02.

Do not use materials containing logs, stumps, sod, weeds, or other perishable matter.

# 1. Classes

The materials are divided into six major classes. Classes I, II, and III are further subdivided and identified by description and physical property requirements specified in the table below and in Table 1. Classes IV, V, and VI are identified by descriptive requirements.

| **Class I**          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IA1 and IA2          | Medium- to well-graded sand or clayey sand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| IA3                  | Fine-grained, silty, or clayey sand; usually less dense than IA1 or IA2. These soils have an excellent bearing capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Class II**         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| IIB1, IIB2, and IIB3 | Medium- to well-graded sandy clays, sandy silts, and clays with some mica. These soils generally have low volume change properties and good densities that serve well as subgrade material.                                                                                                                                                   |
| IIB4                 | Similar to IIB1, IIB2, and IIB3, but generally contain more mica and are more sensitive to moisture. The bearing value of these soils is less predictable. The soils may or may not be satisfactory for subgrade material. Analyze file data or run laboratory and/or field tests for Class IIB4 when considering it for a subgrade material. |



---

# Section 810 — Roadway Materials

# Class III

IIIC1, IIIC2, Medium- to fine-graded micaceous sandy silts, micaceous clayey silts, chert clays, and shaly clays.

IIIC3 and IIIC4 Undesirable characteristics are high volume change properties and/or low densities. The bearing values are unpredictable. The Department recommends testing these materials in a laboratory, where possible, before use. One exception is District 6, where chert clay soils are prevalent.

Chert clay soils (IIIC4) with less than 55% passing the No. 10 (2 mm) sieve may be considered suitable for subgrade materials. These soils are found generally in the northwest corner of the state in Dade, Walker, Catoosa, Whitfield, Murray, Chattooga, Gordon, and Floyd counties.

# Class IV

Highly organic soils or peat, muck, and other unsatisfactory soils generally found in marshy or swampy areas.

# Class V

Shaly materials that are not only finely laminated but have detrimental weathering properties and tend to disintegrate.

# Class VI

Rock or boulders that cannot be readily incorporated into the embankment by layer construction, and that contain insufficient material to fill the interstices when they are placed.

Notes:

- a. The Department may waive this requirement if the supplier warrants the asphalt binder can be adequately pumped and mixed at temperatures meeting all applicable safety standards.
- b. Heat loss by AASHTO: T 179 may be accepted in lieu of mass loss by AASHTO: T 240.
- c. If the creep stiffness is below 300,000 kPa, the direct tension test is not required. If the creep stiffness is ≥300,000 kPa, report the Direct Tension Failure Strain value. Satisfy the m-value requirement in either case.
- d. Ensure the maximum Phase Angle measured by DSR is ≤ 75 degrees.
- e. The maximum Mass Loss shall be ≤ 1%, when used in conjunction with Bituminous Surface Treatment (Section 424).
- f. MSCR requirement is applicable to the SBR, Crumb Rubber &#x26; TOR (or other OMR approved additive) combination modified PG 76-22 asphalt cement. Additionally, ensure the materials meet all PG 76-22 requirements except for phase angle as detailed in sub-section 820.2.01.A.2.
- g. Ensure MSCR requirement for Average Percent Recovery at 3.2 kPa is > 35% for laboratory or terminally blended PG 64-22 or PG 67-22 modified using SBR or GTR to meet PG 76-22 requirements.
- h. Polymer Separation Test is performed by the Department for SBR and crumb rubber modified PG 76-22.
- i. PG 64-22 or PG 67-22 modified to meet PG 76-22 using crumb rubber, via dry method, will be evaluated using complete analysis for compliance with PG 76-22 requirements prior to mixture production using laboratory blended materials. PG 64-22 or PG 67-22 modified to meet PG 76-22 using crumb rubber via dry method, will be evaluated for compliance with original DSR testing requirements for PG 76-22 during mixture production using abson recovery in accordance with GDT 119 in compliance with AC sampling frequencies established in GSP 21 sub-section A.9.
- j. PG 64-22 or PG 67-22 modified to meet PG 76-22 using crumb rubber, via the dry method, will be evaluated for MSCR (Jnr @ 3.2 kPa) requirements, in accordance with GDT 119, on AC samples obtained for project assurance at frequencies established in GSP 21 sub-section A.9.

Note 1: May be acceptable for limited use in conjunction with OMAT’s recommendation

Note 2: Slurry Seal containing CQS-1h must set sufficiently within 2 hours to allow traffic to resume.

Note 3: In the laboratory, Slurry Seal containing CQS-1h shall not set while being mixed according to GDT 91 for a minimum of 90 seconds.

Note 4: Failure to break within 30 minutes after application and/or other than minor tracking of the tack once it has broken may subject the non-tracking tack product to re-evaluation for QPL 7 “Georgia’s List of Approved Bituminous Materials”.

Note 5: The 24-hour storage stability test may be used. However, this test does not predict whether the 5-day settlement test will pass.

Note 6: Perform the demulsibility test within 30 days from date of manufacture.

Note 7: AASHTO T 59 modified to include a maximum temperature of 350 °F ± 10 °F to be held for 20 minutes.

Note 8: Use Residue by Evaporation for all testing on residue material. Residue by Distillation may be used if penetration, softening point and/or ductility test fail on residue by evaporation.

Design procedures: For all Superpave and 4.75 mm mixes, ensure conformance with the Superpave System for Volumetric Design (AASHTO T 312 and AASHTO R30), as adapted in SOP-2. Ensure Superpave mixes are designed at a design gyration number (Ndes) of 65 gyrations and initial gyration number (Nini) of 6 gyrations. Ensure 4.75 mm mixes, (Ndes) are designed at 50 gyrations, and (Nini) at 6 gyrations. Open-graded mix designs will be designed by the Department in accordance with GDT 114. In all cases, the procedure for measuring Maximum Specific Gravity (Gₘₘ) is AASHTO T 209. In addition to gradation and volumetric analysis, ensure mix designs include the following performance tests, as applicable.

# Performance Test:

# a. Permeability test:

Ensure Superpave and Stone Matrix mix designs include testing according to GDT -1 Measurement of Water Permeability of Compacted Asphalt Paving Mixtures. Ensure specimen air voids for this test are 6.0 ±1.0 %. The average permeability of three specimens may not exceed 3.60 ft per day (125 ×10−5cm per sec).

# b. Moisture susceptibility test:

Fabricate and test specimens in accordance with GDT 66, when required by the Office of Materials and Testing due to visible signs of stripping in laboratory fabricated or plant produced asphaltic concrete mixtures, ensure specimen air voids for this test are 7.0 ±1.0% for all mixes excluding Stone Matrix mixes. Ensure specimen air voids for this test are 6.0 ± 1.0% for Stone Matrix mixes. The minimum tensile splitting ratio is 0.80, except a tensile splitting ratio of no less than 0.70 may be acceptable if all individual strength values exceed 100 psi (690 kPa). Ensure average splitting strength of the three conditioned and three controlled samples are not less than 60 psi (415 kPa) for either group. Ensure retention of coating as determined by GDT 56 is not less than 95%.

# c. Hamburg Wheel-Tracking Test for rutting and moisture susceptibility test:

Ensure mix designs of all mix types except Open-graded Surface Mixes (OGFC and PEM), and Open-graded Crack Relief Interlayer (OGI) mix, include testing in accordance with AASHTO T 324. Ensure specimen air voids for this test are 7.0 ± 1.0% for all mix types and at a testing temperature of 50°C (122°F). Use the testing and acceptance criteria established in Table 2.

# C. Acceptance

See Subsection 106.03 and Section 400. Ensure individual test results meet the Mixture Control Tolerances listed in Subsections 828.2, 828.2.01, 828.2.02, 828.2.03, or 828.2.04, whichever applies with the following exception. Ensure field verification results for rutting susceptibility tests performed on laboratory fabricated and/or roadway cores obtained from asphalt plant produced mixtures meet specified requirements for AASHTO T 324 as detailed in Subsection 828.2.B.2.c. All GDOT approved mix designs are required to have full field mix design verifications, using plant produced mixture, sampled by the contractor and submitted to the applicable GDOT laboratory (Central or District) at a minimum of once per two years. Field mix design verification results that fail to comply with performance testing specified in Subsection 828.2.B will require a complete laboratory mix design verification, to be completed by the original mix designer, for continued use of that design. If a mix design has not been produced within two years, a full field mix design verification will be sampled by the contractor and submitted to the applicable GDOT laboratory (Central or District) on the first Lot produced thereafter. Any mix design that fails to meet performance test requirements established in Subsection 828.2.B, using laboratory fabricated specimens due to failing field mix design results, may subject that mix design to invalidation after the field mix design verification results are confirmed with a second field mix design verification. Field mix design verifications as specified in Section 402, Section 400, SOP 2 and GSP 21, are not precluded by the requirements specified herein.

- Take coating thickness measurements on the wrench flats according to ASTM Recommended Practice E 376.
- Ensure no single coating thickness measurement is less than the required individual Specimen value shown on Table 1 of ASTM A 153/A 153M.

Hardness Test

Perform hardness tests on galvanized components after galvanizing the item and removing the coating.

Rotational Capacity Test

Rotational capacity tests are required on all black or galvanized (after galvanizing) assemblies prior to shipping. The following directions are for Department personnel:

- Test each combination of bolt production lot, nut lot, and washer lot as an assembly.
- The Project Engineer may require additional rotational-capacity tests on assemblies covered by Subsections 852.2.03.C.4.b.7 and 852.2.03.C.4.b.9.

Rotational Capacity Test: Bolts Too Short to Fit in Tension Calibrator

a. Equipment Required:

- Calibrated manual torque wrench and a 1ft. (300 mm) long wrench.
- Spacers and/or washers with holes that do not exceed the bolt diameter by 1/16 in. (2 mm) for bolts equal to or less than 1 inch (24 mm) in diameter. The hole size for larger bolts shall not exceed the bolt diameter by 1/8 in. (3 mm).
- Steel section with holes to match bolt sizes.

NOTE: Use a plate thick enough to accomplish Step 1 in the procedure without spacers. However, spacers are acceptable.

b. Procedure:

1. Mark off a vertical line and lines one-third of a turn, 120 degrees; half of a turn 180 degrees; and two-thirds of a turn, 240 degrees from vertical in a clockwise direction on the plate.
2. Measure the bolt length, the distance from the underside of the bolt head to the end of the bolt.
3. Install a nut on the bolt and measure the stick-out of the bolt when three to five full threads of the bolt are located between the bearing face of the nut and the bolt head.
4. Install the bolt in the appropriate size hole and, if necessary, install the required number of spacers to produce the thread stick-out measured in step 1 (always use at least one washer under the nut).
5. Snug the nut with the hand wrench. Snug should be the normal effort applied to a 12 in. (300 mm) long wrench. Do not exceed 20 percent of the torque determined in step 7.
6. Align the nut with the vertical (0 degree) stripe on the test frame plate. This is for reference after you rotate the nut during testing.

# 861.2 Materials

# A.  Definition and Limitation of Defects

Decay: Disintegration of the wood substance due to wood-destroying fungi. The words “dote” and “rot” mean the same as decay. Red heart is a form of decay.

Compression Wood: An abnormal, dense, hard growth frequently occurring on the underside of limbs and leaning trunks of coniferous trees. It is characterized by very wide and eccentric annual growth rings and includes what appears to be an exceptional proportion of summerwood growth. The contrast in color between springwood and summerwood, however, is usually less in compression wood than in normal wood.

Turpentine Butt: A scar caused from bleeding the trees to obtain turpentine.

Scar: A damaged surface caused from injury to the tree during growth.

Sweep: Deviation of a piece or stick from a straight line measured from the center of one end to the center of the other end. A straight line from the center of the butt to the center of the tip shall lie entirely within the body of the pile.

Short Crook: A crook in which the direction of the piece or stick changes in a very short distance measured lengthwise.

Burst Check: A crack approximately at right angles to the annual rings, usually radial cracks in sticks from the center or from near the center to the outside, or a combination of this crack and a ring shake caused through either seasoning, exposure to high temperature, or the process of preservative treatment.

Unsound Knot: A knot solid across the face, but containing incipient decay.

Cluster Knot: Two or more knots grouped together, the fibers of the wood being deflected around the entire unit. A group of single knots with fibers deflected around each knot separately is not a cluster, even though the knots may be close together.

Punk Knot: A fungus decay that extends from the interior of the piece of pile to the outside, which when prodded is usually found to contain a snuff-like substance.

Ring Knots: Three or more knots appearing in the same line of circumference, or any foot of length.

Section 861 — Piling and Round Timber

# 861.2.01 Timber Piles

# A. Requirements

Use round timber piles of any species of wood that will withstand driving and support the load specified. Use plants listed on QPL 50.

# Soundness

Use piles of sound wood, free from decay, red heart, or insect attack.

- Cedar and Cypress: The butt ends may have a pipe or stump rot hole not more than 1-1/2 in. (40 mm) in diameter. Cypress piles may have peck aggregating not more than 1-1/2 in. (40 mm) in diameter.
- Southern Pine: Piles may have unsound knots less than half the permitted size of a sound knot, providing that the unsoundness does not extend more than 1-1/2 in. (40 mm) deep and that the adjacent areas of the trunk are not affected.

# Density

- All piles shall be dense with at least 6 annual rings per 1 in. (25 mm) and 1-1/2 in. (40 mm) or more of summerwood (the darker, harder portion of the annual ring), as measured over the outer 3 in. (75 mm) of butt diameter on a radial line from the pith. The contrast in color between summerwood and springwood shall be sharp and the summerwood shall be darker in color.
- Piles excluded by the above rule may be accepted provided they have at least four annual rings per 1 in. (25 mm) and 1/3 or more summerwood, as measured over the outer 3 in. (75 mm) of butt diameter on a radial line from the pith.

# Knots

- Sound knots:
- For piles 50 ft. (15 m) long or less, and in. Sound knots less than 4 in. (100 mm) or 1/3 the diameter of the pile, whichever is smaller, measured from the butt.
- For the top 1/4 length of piles over 50 ft. (15 m) long: Sound knots less than 5 in. (125 mm) or 1/2 the diameter of the pile, whichever is smaller.

The size of a knot shall be its diameter measured at right angles to the length of the pile.
- Unsound knots are not permitted except in Southern Pine piles as specified in Subsection 861.2.01.A.2.b.
- The sum of sizes of all knots in any 12 in. (300 mm) of the pile shall not exceed twice the size of the largest permitted single knot.

# Holes

Allow holes that average less than 1/2 inch (15 mm) in diameter if the sum of the average diameter of all holes in any 1 ft.² (0.1m²) of pile surface is less than 1-1/2 in. (40 mm).

# Splits and Shakes

Splits shall not be longer than the butt diameter of the pile. The length of any shake or combination of shakes in the outer half of the radius of butt of the pile, when measured along the curve of the annual ring, shall not exceed 1/3 the circumference of the butt of the pile.

# Sapwood

Piles to be treated with preservative shall have at least 1 in. (25 mm) of sapwood at the butt end.

# Heartwood

- In untreated piles for use in exposed work, the diameter of the heartwood at the butt shall be at least 8/10 of the diameter of the pile at the butt.
- If high heartwood content is required for untreated foundation piles, the plans will specify the ratio of heartwood to total diameter.

Section 861 — Piling and Round Timber

# Peeling

- Peel piles by removing all of the outer bark and at least 80 percent of the inner bark, well distributed over the surface of the pile.
- If piles will be treated with preservative, do not leave inner bark wider than 1/2 in. (15 mm).
- Do not remove more than three annual rings of the solid wood.

# Cutting and Trimming

- Saw butts and tips square with the axis of the pile.
- Trim or smoothly cut all knots and limbs flush with the surface of the pile or the surface of the swell surrounding the knot.

# Straightness

In general, a straight line from the center of the butt to the center of the tip shall lie entirely within the body of the pile. If specified, the Department can accept long piles for foundations (but not for trestles) if the straight line lies partly outside the body of the pile. The maximum distance between the line and the pile shall not exceed 0.5 percent of the length of the pile or 3 in. (75 mm), whichever is smaller.

# Taper

Cut piles above the butt swell so it has a continuous taper from the point of butt measurement to the tip.

# Twist of Grain

Do not allow spiral grain to exceed 180 degrees of twist when measured over any 20 ft. (6 m) section of the pile.

# Limits of Defects

- Piles shall not have short crooks that deviate more than 2-1/2 in. (65 mm) from straightness in any 5 ft. (1.5 m) length.
- Burst checks in piles shall be less than 1 in. (25 mm) wide, measured at the outside, and shall not extend over 12 in. (300 mm) long.

# Circumferences, Diameters, and Lengths

- The circumferences of piles measured under the bark shall have the minimum and maximum values in Table 1 (metric Table 1) for the class specified. No more than 10 percent of the piles in any shipment may have circumferences 2 in. (50 mm) less than the tabulated minimum values.
- NOTE: Requirements for tip circumference of piles that are longer than the required length may be applied at the tip end of the required length.
- The ratio of the maximum to the minimum diameter at the butt of any pile shall not exceed 1.2.
- Individual piles may vary from the length specified by ± 12 in. (300 mm) in piles shorter than 40 ft. (12 m), and ± 2 ft. (600 mm) in piles 40 ft. (12 m) or longer.
- The average length of all piles of a specified length in each lot shall not be less than the length specified.

Section 865 — Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members

# B. Fabrication

# General Plant Requirements

Furnish erection drawings to the Engineer that show the placement of superstructure units, especially when the units are not interchangeable with respect to transverse placement within a span or with respect to the reversal of ends within a span.

# Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment

Ensure that the prestressed concrete bridge members are made at a plant that has as a minimum the facilities and equipment specified as follows:

1. Do not start manufacturing until the Engineer approves the facilities and equipment.

NOTE: Regardless of approval, the Contractor is responsible for the facilities’ performance and obtaining additional equipment as needed.

Beds: Construct beds for casting prestressed concrete of concrete; these shall be level or on a grade acceptable to the Engineer.
Anchorages: Design and construct anchorages so they will not yield under 150 percent of the maximum design load.
Forms: Construct steel side and bottom forms unless the Department allows other materials.
1. Design the forms so the bridge members will be well within the tolerances specified in Subsection 865.2.01.B.11.
2. Anchor the forms to prevent movement.

Stressing Equipment
1. Jacks: Use jacks in good repair that do not leak. Calibrate them with the actual gauge or gauges that you will be using. You may use pressure gauges, load cells, or dynamometers. Ensure all jack systems have devices that prevent the gauge pointer from fluctuating.
2. Calibration: Calibrate all devices to a reading accuracy of 2 percent within the proposed stressing range. Use an approved testing laboratory to calibrate the devices. Have the laboratory furnish at least five copies of the calibration chart for each device to the Engineer. Recalibrate all stressing systems at least every 6 months and as required by the Engineer. Use gauges that you can read from 6 ft. (1.8 m) and have a capacity of twice the maximum load.

Elongation Measurement: Use a system approved by the Engineer and isolated from any movement in the bed or anchorages.
Curing Systems Equipment: Use one of the curing methods listed below. Do not use curing compounds on prestressed concrete units unless the Engineer gives written permission.
1. Water Curing: Use equipment that consists of a clean, non-deleterious water source, a method of application, and enough burlap or other means of moisture retention that will keep all surfaces of the concrete wet during the curing cycle, except those in contact with the forms.
2. Steam Curing: Use the following minimum basic equipment:
- An enclosure tight enough to maintain a uniform atmospheric temperature around the concrete units.
- A steam system that distributes live steam uniformly through nozzles, capable of maintaining a temperature of at least 120 ºF (50 ºC) in all weather. Do not eject steam directly against concrete or forms.
- A controlling device installed in the steam line that helps maintain a constant temperature.
- A recording thermometer for each 200 ft. (60 m) of bed length.

1647

---

Section 865 — Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members

3) Heated Forms: Uniformly heat the forms with a recirculating system that distributes the heat evenly. Use a system that includes:

- A means of retaining moisture on concrete surfaces, except those in contact with the forms.
- A recording thermometer for each 200 ft. (60 m) of bed length.
- A weathertight covering for each bed to ensure uniform heating throughout the bed.

h. Vibrators: Use internal vibrators with at least 4,500 impulses per minute. Ensure the vibrator heads are small enough to reach through the prestressing and reinforcing steel to all portions of the form.

1. Use enough vibrators to properly compact the concrete. Have an additional stand-by vibrator in good operating condition for each concrete placing operation.
2. Get the Engineer’s approval of the vibration procedure and of the number and types of vibrators before pouring.
3. You may use external vibration in conjunction with internal vibration when the Engineer so approves.

i. Grout Pump: Use grout pumps that can pump the fluid grout and maintain a uniform pressure of 75 lbs./in.² (520 kPa) for at least 15 seconds.

j. Storage Areas: Use plant storage areas that have surfaces capable of supporting the prestressed concrete bridge members without settlement. Ensure the storage area has blocks to support the units properly at the required points.

# Substitution of Reinforcement

You may substitute welded wire fabric for the bar reinforcement shown on the plans. The Department will not pay extra for the substitution. The substitution is subject to the following:

1. a. Design Notes: Submit detailed shop drawings and design notes, including any changes, to the Engineer for approval before using welded wire fabric.
2. b. Indicate on the design notes that the welded wire fabric will provide the same or greater strength as that provided by the bar reinforcing shown on the plans.
3. c. Design fabric use according to the latest AASHTO Specification for Highway Bridges. Prepare the drawings on 22 x 36-in. (550 x 990 mm) sheets.
4. d. Have an Engineer registered in the State of Georgia stamp both drawings and notes.
5. e. Design the yield strength for the wire fabric not to exceed 60,000 psi (415 MPa) but not be less than 40,000 psi (275 MPa). Do not splice by welding or mechanical coupling.
6. f. If using welded wire fabric for stirrups of bar reinforcement, embed the wires perpendicular to the axis of the beam at least 6 in. (150 mm) into the slab. Leave at most a clearance of 4 in. (100 mm) from the top of slab to the welded wire fabric.
7. g. Embed at least two cross wires (wires parallel to the longitudinal axis of the beam) in the slab, with the closer cross wire clearing the top of the beam by at least 2 in. (50 mm).
8. h. You may use welded wire fabric in the anchorage zone at the ends of the beam to replace the stirrups that enclose the prestressing steel in the bottom flange, and the vertical stirrups that do not protrude beyond the top of the beam.
9. i. Ensure that the wires perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the beam have the same steel area as that of the bar reinforcing.
10. j. Use either smooth or deformed wires for welded wire fabric. Use the AASHTO Specification for Highway Bridges for the proper methods to embed and splice the fabric.

Section 865 — Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members

# Substitution of Strands

You may use strands of different arrangement, size, or arrangement and size. The Department will not pay extra for the substitution.

The substitution is subject to the following structural and physical requirements:

- a. Ensure that the net prestressed force of the strands after losses equals that shown on the plans.
- b. Ensure that the ultimate strength of the member meets the applicable requirements of AASHTO Specification for Highway Bridges.
- c. Ensure that the eccentricity pattern of the substituted strands is about the same as the pattern shown on the plans.
- d. Before substituting strands, submit to the Engineer all changes and detailed shop drawings, with design notes. Ensure that the design notes indicate compliance with the requirements. Prepare drawings on 22 x 36-in. (550 x 900 mm) sheets.

NOTE: If you propose to use strands that differ in size from those covered in ASTM A 416, submit complete data on the strands to the Engineer for approval. Do not use individual strand couplings.

- e. Have an Engineer registered in the State of Georgia stamp both drawings and notes.

# Concrete Manufacture and Mixing

- a. Manufacture and place concrete according to the requirements of Section 500.
- b. Mix the concrete according to Subsection 500.3.04.E and Subsection 500.3.02.D.2 except when adding HRWR.

# Concrete Pouring

Fabricate the ends of all beams and girders to be vertical in the final erected position.

- a. Rough-float the tops of beams at approximately the initial set.
- b. All nominal lengths shown on the plans are horizontal dimensions.
- c. Ensure that the Fabricator adjusts the lengths, as necessary, to account for the final erected position of the member.
- d. Slope bearing assemblies to accommodate the erected position of the member.

# Methods of Prestressing

You may either pretension, post-tension, or combine these methods to prestress concrete bridge members.

- a. Pretensioning: You may pretension with either the single-strand or the multi-strand jacking method.

NOTE: Do not use strands from more than one source in any one tensioning operation.

1649

---

Section 865 — Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members

Ensure the method used meets these requirements:

1. Strand Splices: Get approval from the Engineer for splicing methods and devices.
| Jacking Method | Action                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single-strand  | Use only one splice per strand.                        |
| Multi-strand   | Splice all strands or no more than 10% of the strands. |

Ensure that the spliced strands have similar physical properties, are from the same source, and have the same “twist” or “lay.” Locate splices outside the prestressed units.
2. Wire Failures: The Engineer may accept wire failures if the area of broken wires does not exceed 2 percent of the total area of the strands.
3. Stressing Preparations: Prepare the members as follows:
1. Carefully place and thread all strands in the bed.
2. Avoid contaminating the strand with oil, grease, or other bond breaking material. If any strand is contaminated, clean the strand with a suitable solvent or replace the strand.
3. After final stressing, position all strands within the location tolerances specified in Subsection 865.2.01.B.11.
4. Use strand vises designed for the size of pretensioning strand to anchor the strand.
5. After anchoring, ensure that the vises sustain the pretensioning force without slipping until the release of stress. Ensure that the vise grips seat no more than 1/4 in. (6 mm) each.
6. To prevent strands from bonding together, encase the strand in a conduit that can resist the pressure exerted by the concrete.
7. Use conduit with an ID allowing free movement of the encased strand, but no greater than the diameter of the strand plus 1/8 in. (3 mm).
8. Secure the conduit to prevent both longitudinal movement along the strand and bonding at the location shown on the plans, ± 1 in. (25 mm).
9. Tape the conduit to keep concrete out. Use tape and conduit manufactured from a non-corrosive material compatible with both the concrete and steel. Do not debond the strand for the full length of members.
4. Pretensioning Operation: Use elongation to control this operation. Ensure that the hydraulic pressure gauge readings at the time of the measured net elongation are within 5 percent of the calculated gauge reading for that particular elongation. Ensure that the net elongation and final gauge measurements agree within ± 5 percent of their computed theoretical values. The measurements of force and elongation shall algebraically agree with each other within a 5% tolerance. If any measurement varies by more than 5 percent, the Department will stop all work. Correct the defect before proceeding. Pretension the members as follows:
1. Initial Tension: After threading the strand in the bed, apply an initial tensioning force to each strand. Do not use elongation to measure the amount of initial tension, but use a dynamometer, hydraulic jack gauge, or dead weight.



---

Section 865 — Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members

b) Final Tension: Calculate the final stress from the final elongation measured between established reference points. Use points that are independent of any movement in the bed or anchorages that might occur during the pretensioning operation. Calculate the design elongation as follows:

|   | D = PL |
| - | ------ |
| A | E      |

D = Design elongation in inches (millimeters).

P = Tensioning force, in pounds (kilonewtons); subtract the initial tensioning force from P.

L = Distance from dead end anchorage to reference point, measured in inches (millimeters)

A = Cross-sectional area of strand, in square inches (millimeters).

E = Modulus of elasticity of strand, in pounds per square inch (MPa).

c) Add correction factors to the design elongation for strand anchorage slip and temperature. Correct any movement in the anchorage abutments or in the overall anchorage system. Use the final elongation figure as the net elongation in jacking the strand.

d) Single-Strand Jacking: Do not let the jack ram rotate more than one revolution while stressing any strand.

e) Draped Strand Jacking: Partially jack draped strands from the end of the bed to add tension. Raise or lower the strands to their final position to get the final tension. Ensure that the strands have no more than four points where the strand changes slope, two of which shall be at each anchorage. Use approved, low friction devices at pick-up and hold-down points. Make the devices maintain the desired vertical and horizontal positioning of the strand. After partial jacking, deflect the strands to their final position in a sequence approved by the Engineer.

f) Final Readings: After final stressing, position all strands within the location tolerances specified in Subsection 865.2.01.B.11.

g) Calculate the final elongation according to Subsection 865.2.01.B.7.a.4).b). Uniformly distribute stress in the strands throughout the bed length.

5) Detensioning Operation: Before detensioning, submit the pattern and schedule for releasing the strands to the Engineer for advance approval. Detension the members as follows:

a) Strip or loosen forms that tend to restrict the horizontal or vertical movement of the member prior to releasing the stress.

b) If curing with steam, carefully release the strand because of dimensional changes due to temperature and shrinkage changes. Where possible, release the pretensioned strand while the units are moist and warm.

c) In deflected strand construction, immediately release the hold down devices within the member or members after curing with steam.

6) Stress Release Strength: You may transfer stress to the concrete, unless otherwise specified on the plans or in the Special Provisions, based on the following requirements (minimum strength determined by cylinders cast of the same concrete):

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single strand   | Heat each strand and allow it to pull itself apart in the sequence of the approved pattern and schedule of release. Do not cut the strands.                                                                                                  |
| Multiple strand | Release either a symmetrical group of strands or all of the strands simultaneously. Remove the load on the strands from the anchorage and place it on the jacking system. Gradually release the jack or jacks until the strands are relaxed. |

# b. Post-tensioning:

Use either the system required by the plans or an approved alternate system. Alternate systems may include the post-tensioning of both straight and draped tendons. Ensure that the system meets the appropriate requirements that follow:

1. Tendons: Do not splice post-tensioning tendons.
2. Ducts: Accurately position the ducts in which post-tensioning tendons are placed and securely fasten them to prevent movement during concrete placement. Use flexible metal conduit, metal tubing, or other acceptable material for the ducts.
3. Stressing Requirements: Prepare the members as follows:
1. Carefully thread tendons into the ducts.
2. Avoid contaminating the strand with oil, grease, or other bond breaking material. If any strand is contaminated, clean the strand with a suitable solvent or replace the strand.
3. Follow the stressing procedures and sequences approved by the Engineer.
4. After stressing, anchor the tendons against the ends of the members and fill the ducts with grout.

1652

Section 865 — Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members

4) Concrete Strength: Stress the post-tensioning tendons after the concrete in the member has reached the minimum strength and age requirements, as follows:

| Minimum Strength  | Age    |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| 4500 psi (30 MPa) | 3 days |
| 4000 psi (28 MPa) | 5 days |

c. Post-tensioning Operation: In general, tension straight tendons from one end. Simultaneously tension draped tendons from each end. Pretension the members as follows:

1. Initial Tension: After threading the tendon in the duct, apply an initial tensioning force of up to 5 percent of the final tensioning force with a jack. Determine the initial tension by reading the gauge. Do not use elongation to measure the amount of initial tension.
2. Final Tension: Compute the final stress on tendons from the amount of the final elongation measurement, checked by the jack pressure gauge reading.
3. Gauge Reading: Ensure that the pressure gauge reading at the time of the measured elongation is within 5 percent of the calculated gauge reading for that particular elongation. If the gauge pressure reading varies by more than 5 percent from the calculated reading, stop the stressing operation and correct the defect before proceeding.
4. Jacking: While jacking draped tendons, ensure that jack pressures and elongations are kept as near equal as is possible at each of the two jacks so the elongation measurements and jack pressures remain proportional.
5. Anchor Devices: Design anchor devices that secure the tendon for the size of post-tensioning tendon used. After anchoring, ensure that the devices can maintain a prestressed load of 150 percent of the maximum design load and do not slip more than 1/8 in (3 mm) after anchoring. Place anchor devices exactly at right angles to the axes of the post-tensioned tendons. Carefully note anchorage losses and take the proper corrective measures to ensure that the tendon has the final design stress.

# Grouting

- a. Time Limitations: Complete all grouting within 48 hours after post-tensioning.
- b. Grout: Make grout to a consistency of thick paint.
1. Mix, by volume, 1 part Portland cement, 0.75 part (max.) sand passing a No. 30 (600 μm) sieve, and 0.75 part (max.) water.
2. Within the limit specified, vary the proportions of sand and water as required by the Engineer.
3. If you need to fill enclosures as hereinafter specified, you may eliminate sand and use a neat cement grout in the mix.
4. After adding all ingredients, mix the batch for three minutes.
5. Make batches of grout small enough so that the batch may all be used up in less than 45 minutes.
6. Immediately before grouting, blow out tendon ducts with compressed air. Ensure that the compressed air does not contain oil.
7. Vent each duct at each end. Ensure the vent has the means for positive closure when subjected to a minimum pressure of 75 psi (515 kPa).
8. Pump the grout into the duct towards an exit vent.
9. After the grout has expelled all entrapped air and is flowing in a solid stream, close the exit vent and build the pumping pressure to a minimum of 75 psi (515 kPa). Hold it at that level for a minimum of 15 seconds.
10. Close the grout entrance vent.
11. Do not move or disturb the member at all for at least 48 hours after grouting.

# Concrete Finish

- a. Beams
1. Finish the outside face of certain exterior beams specified in the Table of Bridge Areas Requiring a Type III Finish in Subsection 500.3.05.AB with the Type III Special Surface Coating Finish.
2. Finish all other beams with a steel form finish.
3. Score the surfaces of the top flanges of all beams with a stiff wire brush or equivalent. Score the beams transverse to the longitudinal axis of the beams.
4. Transversely scrub the entire beam top with a coarse brush to remove all laitance and to produce a roughened surface for bonding to the slab. Remove all concrete fins or projections to produce a vertical face at the edge of the beam.
5. If using prestressed concrete deck panels, finish both sides of the beam’s top flange with a trowel for 2 in. (50 mm) from each panel edge to ensure a smooth and level bearing area.
- b. Superstructure Deck Units: Finish the riding surface of superstructure deck units—flat slabs, channels, double tees, etc.—as specified in Subsection 500.3.05.T.9 and the plans. Finish the traffic face and top face of curbs on exterior units and the outside face of certain exterior beams as specified in the Table of Bridge Areas Requiring a Type III Finish in Subsection 500.3.05.AB.
- c. Substructure Units: Finish the top surfaces of caps and piling with the Type IV—Floated Surface Finish specified in Subsection 500.3.05.AB.5.
- d. Patching: The Engineer will inspect all honeycombed areas. The Engineer may reject bridge members with extensive honeycombs within bearing areas.
1. Patch as directed by the Engineer, as soon as possible after form stripping.
2. The Engineer may require that you use an epoxy bonding compound.
3. Remove hold-down devices from the bottoms of the beams.
4. Coat the resulting holes with an epoxy bonding compound and plug them with grout.

# Concrete Curing

Cure concrete with one of the methods listed below. Provide means for keeping the temperature of bridge members above the freezing point for 6 days after concrete placement, except for steam curing. The Department may reject bridge members based on improper curing.

1. Water Curing: Cover all concrete surfaces that are not in contact with the forms with wet burlap or other suitable material. Keep the member wet for 7 days or until the concrete has reached the stress release strength specified in Subsection 865.2.01.B.7.a.(6).
2. Steam Curing: Do not begin steam curing for at least four hours after final placement of concrete.
1. The Engineer may delay the start longer if the concrete has not taken its initial set. You may use sufficient heat during the delay to maintain the temperature of the concrete between 50 º and 70 ºF (10 º and 21 ºC).
2. Ensure the steam curing enclosures retain moisture and heat.
3. After steaming begins, you may raise the enclosure temperature at a maximum rate of 80 ºF (27 ºC) per hour until the surface temperature of the concrete reaches an optimum temperature, not to exceed 190 ºF (88 ºC).
4. Ensure that the differential surface temperature of the concrete within a member does not exceed 40 ºF (4 ºC) during the curing period.
5. Continue steaming until reaching the stress release strength.
6. Lower the enclosure temperature at a maximum rate of 40 ºF (4 ºC) per hour.
7. Maintain a film of water on all exposed surfaces of the concrete during the steam curing cycle.
8. Do not exceed the maximum temperatures.
9. The Department may reject bridge members based on excessive temperature.
3. Heated Forms: When using approved heated forms, keep the exposed surfaces of the concrete wet at all times.
1. Enclose the beds with a suitable weather-tight covering supported to uniformly heat throughout the bed.
2. Apply the requirements stated in Subsection 865.2.01.B.10.b concerning the delay period, temperature control, curing duration, and basis of rejection.

# Tolerances

1. Manufacture prestressed concrete bridge members within the dimensional tolerances listed in SOP-3, Standard Operating Procedures for Precast/Prestressed Concrete. These tolerances generally will be the maximum deviation allowed, although normal manufacturing tolerances will be well within those listed.
2. The Department may reject bridge members based on excessive deviations.

# Galvanized Coatings

1. Before shipping beams, galvanize the exposed surfaces and edges of embedded structural steel bearing components and all exposed surfaces of attached structural steel bearing components according to ASTM A 123/ A 123M or A 153/ A 153M.
2. Touch up all areas to be welded after the welded area has cooled, and the weld is completed and cleaned.
3. Galvanize miscellaneous structural steel, hardware, bolts, and washers prior to storage at the casting yard or jobsite.

1655

Section 865 — Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members

# Marking

NOTE: This requirement does not apply to single point pick-up locations placed on piling.

1. With the exception of the Department’s inspection stamp, the Contractor is responsible for the placement and accuracy of all markings on bridge members according to these specifications.
2. The Inspector will not act for the manufacturer with respect to marking, but will cooperate with the plant personnel to ensure that the work is properly done with respect to time of marking, accuracy of description, and accuracy of location of marks and lettering.
3. Locate the markings so they are hidden after completing Project construction.
4. Do not ship any unit from the plant until it carries the official GDT stamp and number assigned by the Department to the Inspector at the plant, nor until the Inspector checks and approves the markings required by these specifications.
5. Required Markings: Clearly mark bridge members to indicate the Project identification, date of manufacture, beam identification number (properly located to coordinate with the erection drawing), pile length, and location of pile single-point pick up.
6. Time of Marking
1. Before Stress Transfer: Immediately after forms are removed and before transferring stress, individually identify and date members. This helps keep accurate records on each member’s bed location and date of concrete placement.
2. Before Shipping: Give the Inspector advance notice of shipping. After securing members for shipment, apply marking consisting of the Project identification to each member.
7. The Inspector will place the GDT stamp and number on each member. The Inspector will not use the GDT stamp until after the members have been satisfactorily finished and stored.

# Handling and Storing

1. Prestressing Steel: Protect all prestressing steel from contact with dissimilar metals to prevent galvanic action and excessive rusting.
1. The Department will not consider light rust that does not visibly etch the steel as detrimental.
2. Keep prestressing steel free of harmful materials, such as grease, oil, wax, clay, dirt, paint, and loose rust.
3. Use special care to keep prestressing steel free of form oil and other bond-reducing material that may be used on the forms.
4. Handle prestressing steel at all times in such manner as to prevent kinks and nicks. The Department will not allow prestressing tendons that have kinks, nicks, bends, or other defects.
5. Do not use torches or welding equipment adjacent to tensioned strand unless the strand is insulated against heating or burning.
2. Reinforcement Steel: Handle, place, and support all reinforcement steel according to the requirements of Section 511.
3. Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members: Handle, store, and ship prestressed concrete bridge members in a way to eliminate the danger of cracks, fractures, and excessive bending stresses. Handle members by the two embedded pick-up points, unless the Engineer approves other methods.
1. Except for piling, handle members so their vertical axes remain plumb at all times.
2. Support members in storage on firm blocking located immediately below the two embedded pick up points. In multiple layer storage, support members in the stack with blocks of uniform thicknesses and in a vertical line.
3. Set all blocking at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the member, and the longitudinal axis of the blocking shall be horizontal. Do not ship members until the concrete reaches its ultimate design strength.



---

Section 865 — Manufacture of Prestressed Concrete Bridge Members

NOTE: Replace members that were damaged in handling or storage at no additional expense to the Department. However, the Engineer may determine that the damage is minor and may approve use of the member.

# d. Piling:

Handle, store, and ship piling after stress release.

1. The Department may reject any piling cracked in handling, storing, or loading if the crack warrants.
2. The Department will reject any cracked piling destined for locations involving sea water or alkali soils.
3. Mark rejected pile as rejected.
4. Store piling in groups with the same length.
5. Transport piling in a manner approved by the Engineer. Upon request, the Engineer will furnish drawings giving the limits of truck bolster spacing for various sizes and lengths of piling.

# e. Beams:

Handle or store fully pretensioned beams after stress release.

1. Use pick-up and support points within 3 ft. (900 mm) of the beam ends.
2. Support beams on firm blocking located within 3 ft. (900 mm) of the permanent bearing area of the beam.
3. You may handle or store fully post-tensioned beams 48 hours after the grout has been placed in the tendon ducts.
4. For beams manufactured by the combined method of pretensioning and post-tensioning, you may handle and store them after the pretensioning phase is completed. Do not handle again until 48 hours after grout placement.
5. Do not ship beams and other superstructure units until after their strength reaches the required minimum 28-day design strength.
6. Store beams in single layers, not in stacks. Support beams so they meet the following requirements concerning warp and sweep:

| Twist of vertical axes of the ends of beams due to misalignment of blocking                                | The maximum deviation between the vertical axes of the ends of beams shall be 1/4 in./ft. (20 mm/m) of beam height. |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tilt of vertical axis of an end of beam from the vertical due to deviation of blocking from the horizontal | The maximum deviation of the vertical axis of an end of a beam shall be 1/4 in./ft. (20 mm/m) of beam height.       |
| Lateral sweep due to manner of storage                                                                     | There shall be no discernible sweep induced by the manner in which a beam is stored.                                |

# C. Acceptance

# Plant Inspection

1. Give Notice to the Engineer: Give the Engineer ample notice before starting work so that the Engineer can inspect all plant facilities involved in the production. Do not manufacture anything until the Engineer approves all facilities.
2. Facilities for Inspection: Allow free access to the Inspector to all parts of the plant involved in the production process.
3. Inspector Authority: The Inspector has the authority to reject materials or quality of work that do not meet the specifications. In cases of dispute, the Contractor may appeal to the Engineer, whose decision will be final.

# 3. Filling and Packaging

The manufacturer shall strain paints before filling the containers. The manufacturer also shall ship paints in strong, substantial containers (according to QPL 46 and QPL 73) plainly marked with the paint name and number, color, volume, manufacturer name and address, date of manufacture, and the manufacturer’s lot number on every package. The inspection stamp on the paint container will be evidence of approval. Traffic line paint manufactured for the Department shall be delivered in 55 gallon (208 L) drums or 250 gallon (946 L) totes. The manufacturer shall stencil on the head of each drum the kind of paint, requisition number, purchase order number, and gross and net weights. Ensure that the drums are the removable head types. Ensure the totes are labeled appropriately.

# 4. Finished Paints

Unless otherwise specified, deliver paints to the Project or the Department completely mixed and ready for use without adding oils or thinner. Use well ground paints that do not settle or badly cake in the container, and can readily be broken up to a smooth, uniform paint with good brushing consistency. When brushed or rolled on a smooth, vertical surface, the paint shall dry hard and elastic without running, streaking, sagging, or spotting. Use paint for spray application that sprays satisfactorily and does not run, sag, or streak. The first coat of paint applied in the shop or in the field to uncoated structural steel or wood is called the primer coat. The paint covering the primer coat is called the second coat, and the paint covering the second coat is called the third coat.

# B. Fabrication

The formulas given in this specification represent proportions by weight.

# C. Acceptance

# 1. Testing

Test methods for paint analyses shall be according to the Federal Test Methods, Standard No. 141 or the ASTM standard methods of tests for paint.

# 2. Color

Match color visually by comparing with standard color chips obtained from the Office of Materials and Research.

# 3. Inspection

Inspection and analysis will be made at the point of manufacture according to SOP 14. The manufacturer shall assist as necessary, permit the Inspector to test the ingredients before the paint is made, and witness the paint grinding. The Department reserves the right to sample and test all paint at any time before it is used.

# 4. Tolerances

The Department will accept a tolerance of 1 percent of the required value for the paint formulation and property requirements.

EXCEPTION: This tolerance does not apply where maximum and minimum values are noted.

# D. Materials Warranty

The following people shall furnish the Department a certificate of analysis and manufacturer’s guarantee:

- The manufacturer of each brand of paint submitted for acceptance under these specifications
- All Contractors proposing to use any paint specified in this Section

Ensure that the certificate of analysis shows the paint trade name to be furnished, including a facsimile of the label if the paint is ready-mixed, and an analysis showing the percentage of each of the chemical elements and compounds in the pigment and vehicle. The guarantee shall assert that all paint furnished conforms to the analysis shown on the certificate filed and to the statement of percentages of ingredients shown on the labels, which are required to be on each container. The guarantee shall be sworn to by a person having authority to bind the manufacturer into an agreement.

# B. Fabrication

# 1. No. 2B, Aluminum

Prepare the aluminum paint by thoroughly mixing aluminum paste with mixing vehicle.

- Ensure the paints are well ground, do not settle or cake badly in the container, and are readily broken up to a smooth, uniform paint of good brushing consistency.
- Use 2 lbs. (0.24 kg) of paste to 1.0 gal (1.0 L) of vehicle. Mix this at the factory.
- Ensure a thorough mix with a minimum of stirring. Ensure that the paint shows satisfactory leafing qualities and solidly covers in one coat without running, streaking, or sagging.
- If applying two coats of aluminum paint, tint the first coat with iron blue paste to help distinguish the two coats.

# 12. AC Line Monitoring

1. AC Line Brownout Recognition
1. Verify that the signal monitor can detect that the AC line has fallen below 98 ±2 VAC for greater than 400 ±50 ms. This shall force the output relay to the de-energized fault state, enable the stop-time output, and cause the AC POWER LED to flash at a 2 Hz rate.
2. Verify that the unit maintains this state until the AC line voltage rises above 103 ±2 VAC for greater than 400 ±50 ms.
3. Provide a jumper option that will change the AC brownout dropout level to 92 ±2 VAC and the restore level to 98 ±2 VAC.
2. AC Line Power-up and Brownout Delay Time

4. Configuration Change Monitoring
1. On power-up, reset, and periodically during operation, verify that the Signal Monitor compares the current configuration settings with the previously stored value and if the settings have changed, the Signal Monitor automatically logs the new setting.
2. Verify that the settings include the permissive diode matrix, switches, jumpers, and the Watchdog Enable switch.
3. Provide a programming option such that change in the configuration parameters will cause the Signal Monitor to enter the fault mode, causing the output relay contacts to close and enabling the stop-time output to the controller.
4. To indicate the fault mode, verify that the PCA indicator will flash at a 4 Hz rate.
5. Depressing the Reset button for a minimum of 5.0 sec is required to clear the fault and log the new configuration parameters.
6. If the programming option is not selected, verify that the unit does not set the fault mode but will still log the configuration change.
5. Exit Flash
1. When the Signal Monitor exits the flash state (output relay de-energized) as a result of a Reset command or AC Line brownout restore, verify that the stop-time output goes to the inactive state 250 ±50 ms before the output relay transfers to the energized state.
2. The transition shall provide an early indication to the controller unit that the cabinet will transfer from flash to signal operation.
6. Display Functions
1. Verify that it is possible to view the active channels for each individual color (GYR) during operation and when latched in a fault state.
2. When the Signal Monitor is latched in a fault state, verify that it is also possible to view the active channels for each individual color and fault status for each channel for the current fault and the two previous faults.
1. When triggered by a fault, the channel status display shall alternate between the channels that were involved in the fault (fault status) for 2 sec and the field signals active at the time of the fault for 6 sec.
2. The channels involved in the fault shall flash their respective green, yellow, and red indicators simultaneously at a 4 Hz rate for the 2 sec interval.
3. The two previous faults may also be displayed individually.

2. e. Ensure the nominal thickness of the cable outer jacket is sufficient to provide adequate cable protection while meeting the mechanical, flammability, and environmental test requirements of this document over the life of the cable.
3. f. Color: Use color coded individual fibers for identification. Ensure color coding complies with EIA/TIA-598-B Optical Fiber Cable Color Coding as stated in 935.2.B.1.e.
4. g. Marking: Mark the outer cable jacket at least every 3 ft. (1 m) with the manufacturer's name or UL file number, date of manufacture, fiber type, flame rating, UL symbol, and sequential length marking (e.g. 62.5/125 MICRON Type OFNR - UL). Use print color that contrasts to the color of the jacket and is permanent and legible for the life of the cable.

# 2. Fabrication by Cable Type

1. a. Interconnect Cables: Use interconnect cable to connect the distribution panels of a fiber optic cable plant with the actual electronic devices. Fabricate interconnect cable by surrounding the 900 μm tight buffered fibers with layered U.S. manufactured aramid yarns and a jacket of PVC or Copolymer depending on NEC requirements. Use the aramid yarns as tensile strength members.
2. b. FDC Interconnect Cable: Use this cable to splice a factory connectorized multifiber pigtail cable on to an OSP cable end, routing that cable within an FDC and its splice cabinet, and connecting to the termination panels of the FDC. Construct FDC interconnect cable of 900 μm tight buffered fiber (single mode or multi-mode optical fiber) surrounded with U.S. manufactured aramid fibers, and jacketed with flame retardant jacket material. Match the fiber count and buffer tube configuration of the FDC interconnect cable to be exactly equivalent to the OSP cable being terminated in the FDC, unless additional fibers (using other buffer tube colors) are required for an FDC that is larger than the OP cable. Use a yellow exterior jacket for the FDC interconnect cable for single-mode.

# 3. Temperature Range

1889

---

# Section 935 — Fiber Optic System

Whenever unreeled cable is placed on the pavement or surface above a manhole, provide means of preventing vehicular or pedestrian traffic through the area in accordance with Section 150 of the specifications.

Use the "figure-eight" cable lay configuration to prevent kinking or twisting when the cable is unreeled or backfed. Do not coil fiber optic cable in a continuous direction except for lengths of 100 ft. (30 m) or less. When "figure-eighting" cable, exercise care to relieve pressure on the cable at the crossover of the eight. This may be done by placing cardboard shims at the crossover or by forming a second "figure-eight". Keep the cable continuous throughout the pull. Cable breaks are allowed only at designated splice points.

Where messenger cable is required, as shown in the plans, lash aerial fiber optic cable to a steel strand wire messenger cable of the size specified in the plans that conforms to Georgia Department of Transportation specification 915.02.

# 6. Cable End Sealing

Where a cable ends without termination in a fiber optic closure, seal the end of the cable by re-using a cable end cap shipped with a cable reel, or use a cap that is size-matched to the cable to be sealed. Clean the end of the cable. Partly fill the cap with a waterproof silicone adhesive sealant and press the cap fully onto the cable end, rotating the cap to fully encapsulate the cable end with the sealant in the cap. Apply a full sealant bead between the end of the cap and the cable jacket.

# C. Cable Storage

At designated intervals throughout the cable plant, pull and store excess cable for slack for future terminations or splicing. Properly store all cable to minimize susceptibility to damage. Maintain proper bend radius, both short and long term, during cable storage.

Communication and Pull Boxes: Store the excess or slack cable in the pull box or communication box in accordance with the plans details.

Hub/TMC/TCC: Properly store the cable in cable troughs and plenum applications which meet NEC requirements.

Aerial Installations: Store the excess or slack cable at storage loops in a “bow tie” configuration on the messenger strand using two fiber optic snowshoes (aerial fiber cable storage brackets) that maintain the proper bend radius in the fiber cable. Install one fiber optic snowshoe for drop cable and trunk cable storage at aerial splice closures to maintain the proper bend radius in the fiber optic cable.

# 935.3.06 Quality Acceptance

# A. Fiber Optic Cable

1. Installation Test
1. Test the fiber optic cabling installed on this project according to the fiber’s assigned use as shown in the plans and as specified below:
2. Upon completion of the cable installation, splicing, and termination, and a minimum of fourteen days before equipment hookup, test all terminated fibers and spare fibers for continuity, events above 0.10 dB, and total attenuation of the cable. In the event that fiber optic cable installed on the project is connected to existing fiber optic cable, perform installation testing on both terminated fibers and spare fibers of the new cable and existing fibers to which the new fibers are spliced or connected. Submit both printed and electronic optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) traces as specified in Subsection 935.1.03.
2. Test Requirements
1. OTDR Test: For all fiber links, test and document the installation using OTDR testing.
2. Conduct installation testing with a certified technician using an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) and optical source/power meter. The technician is directed to conduct the test using the standard operating procedure as defined by the manufacturer of the test equipment. Use an OTDR capable of performing standard OTDR functions, including the ability to display individual loss/gain in dB per km, as well as display all 2-point dB loss cursors to allow isolating and viewing any and all points along a given fiber distance.
3. Use a factory patch cord of a length equal to the "dead zone" of the OTDR to connect the OTDR and the cable. Optionally, the Technician can use a factory "fiber box" of 325 ft. (100 m) minimum with no splices within the box.
4. Conduct the tests at 1310/1550 nm for single mode cable.
5. Attenuation Test: For all single mode and multi-mode fiber links, test and document attenuation by a standard power-meter test.
6. For every fiber installed or connected to, perform end-to-end attenuation test. For the test, use a calibrated optical source and power meter using the standard three-stage procedure. Determine acceptable link attenuation by the cumulative value of standard losses based on length, number and type of splices and connectors.
3. Fiber Optic Cable Acceptance
1. Use the following criteria for acceptance of the cable:
2. Provide test results demonstrating the dB/km loss does not exceed +3% of the factory test or 1% of the cable's published production loss. Consider the error rate for the test equipment in the test.
3. No event can exceed 0.10 dB. If any event is detected above 0.10 dB, replace or repair that event point.
4. The total dB loss of the cable, less events, cannot exceed the manufacturer's production specifications as follows:

1894

---

Section 935 — Fiber Optic System

| Cable Type | Max. Attenuation dB/km | Test Wavelength |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Singlemode | 0.30                   | 1550 nm         |
|            | 0.40                   | 1310 nm         |

e. If the total loss exceeds these specifications, replace or repair that cable run and assume all expenses, both labor and materials. Elevated attenuation due to exceeding the pulling tension during installation will require the replacement of the cable run at no expense to the Department for either labor or materials.

f. NOTE: The Department may allow the "bi-directional/averaging" process of OTDR testing, particularly when splice losses are being unfavorably affected by "mode field diameter misalignment," "core off-set" or "core misalignment."

# B. Fusion Splicing

Ensure that the maximum splice loss for any fusion splice does not exceed 0.10 dB.

# C. Mechanical Splicing

Ensure the maximum splice loss for mechanical splices does not exceed 0.70 dB. As noted in this specification, mechanical splicing is only allowed when approved by the Engineer for temporary applications.

# D. Fiber Distribution Center (FDC)

Number of three-pair shielded cables (n)

Note: Lane numbering shall begin at the median for mainline travel lanes. Lane numbering for ramp meter lanes shall begin with the lane adjacent to the mainline travel lanes.

# B. Saw Cuts

1. Outline the loop on the pavement to conform to the specified configuration.
2. Verify each loop has a separate saw cut with a minimum distance between saw cuts of 6 in (150 mm) to the side of the road and its own drilled hole through the curb.
3. Saw cutting a loop lead across a pedestrian ramp or intersection corner radius is prohibited.
4. Use wet saw only cutting inductance loop slots.
5. Cut the detector loop in a saw slot a minimum of 4 in. (100 mm) deep to provide a minimum of 3 in. (75 mm) of depth to the top of the wire.
6. Verify that the slot is a minimum of 0.25 in. (6 mm) wide for stranded No. 14 AWG loop wire, XLPE or XHHW-2, and a minimum of 0.31 in. (8 mm) wide for polyethylene or PVC-encased No. 14 AWG loop wire.
1. Drill a 2 in. (50 mm) diameter hole or make miter saw cuts in the pavement at the slot intersection, as directed by the Department.
2. Overlap miter saw cuts at the saw cut intersection so that the slots have a full-depth and smooth bottom. Do not make a full triangle cut. Depth shall be uniform.
3. Prevent the wire from bending sharply.

Section 937 — Detection Systems

d. Do not install detector loop wire unless sawed slots are completely dry and free of debris. Pressure wash the slot to guarantee adhesion of the loop sealant. Use compressed air to thoroughly clean out and dry the sawed slot with a minimum of 125 psi (8.8 kg/cm²). Handheld or backpack blowers shall only be used to dry the pavement or remove debris away from the saw cut edge.

e. Install the loop wire starting at the nearest pull box or conduit around the loop in a clockwise direction for the specified number of turns, and back to the pull box or conduit.

f. All quadrupole loops shall be wrapped in a clockwise figure eight configuration.

g. Refer to Standard Detail Drawings for the number of turns to install in the saw slot.

1. Press the wire in the slot without using sharp objects that may damage the jacket.
2. Hold the loop in place every 5 ft. (1.5 m) with 1 in. (25 mm) strips of rubber, neoprene, flexible tubing, or foam backer rod as approved by the Department.
3. Leave the hold down strips in place when filling the slot with loop sealant.
4. Where encased loop wire is used, apply a weathertight seal to the ends of the polyethylene tubing that encases the wire to prevent moisture from entering the tube.
5. Where the loop wires cross pavement joints and cracks, protect the loop wires using the method specified in the Standard Detail Drawings. When crossing expansion joints, drill a 2 in. (50 mm) diameter hole a minimum 4 in. (100 mm) deep or to bottom of saw cut. Do not install loop wires in an expansion joint.
6. Twist loop lead-in four to six turns per foot from the curb to the loop lead-in cable splice or directly to the cabinet. When possible, start the twist of loop wires from the loop’s edge in the saw cut to the loop lead-in cable splice, or directly to the cabinet.

# C. Saw Cut Sealing

1. After successfully testing each loop, fill the slots with sealant to fully encase the conductors using a one-part loop sealant mixture that requires a caulk gun or similar device. See Section 833.2.09.
2. Seal the slot only when the pavement is completely dry.
3. Verify that the sealant is a minimum of 3 in. (75 mm) thick above the top conductor in the saw cut.
4. Apply the sealant so that subsequent expansion does not raise the sealant material above the pavement surface.
5. In case of accidental spill, remove surplus sealant from the adjacent road surfaces without using solvents or epoxy sealants before the sealant sets.
6. Remove excess loop sealant to prevent distorting pavement marking reflectivity, color, or shape.
7. When the Department determines that the loop sealant can accommodate traffic, but the surface is tacky, dust the sealer on the pavement surface with cement dust before opening the roadway to traffic.
8. Dispose of the solvents used to clean loop installation equipment according to the manufacturer’s specifications and local, state, and federal regulations.

Section 937 — Detection Systems

# D. Inductance Loop Connections

1. Connect loop conductors to a shielded lead-in cable that runs from the pull box adjacent the pavement edge or conduit to the controller or field cabinet input panel, unless otherwise specified in the Contract.
2. Use a continuous 3-pair, 14 AWG shielded lead-in cable from the pull box or conduit to the controller or field cabinet input panel. The 3-pair cable shall not be spliced.
3. Do not bond or ground the shield in the loop lead-in cable at the controller cabinet unless induced voltage is present. If voltage is present, then the shield in the loop lead-in cable shall be bonded to controller cabinet equipment bus bar per NEC.
4. Completely tape back all ground shields inside the shielded lead-in cable on both ends of the cable.
5. Connect each loop to an individual detector channel as specified in the Contract.
6. If the Contract specifies that two or more loops will be operated on the same detector channel or detector amplifier unit, wire them in series to their loop lead-in at the pull box or conduit.
7. Use series-parallel connections when series connections do not meet the manufacturer’s specified operating range for the detector amplifier unit.
8. Leave 6 ft. (1.8 m) of wire coiled up in a pull box and make sure the lead wire of each loop is identified inside the pull box.
9. Make weathertight loop wire splices using pill boxes with loop sealant or tape with the following specifications:
1. Verify electrical tape used is flame retardant, and cold and weather resistant.
2. Provide tape that is rated for 600 V and for use between 0°F (−18°C) and 176°F (80°C).
3. Verify tape is 0.0085 in. (0.2 mm) thick and meets the requirements of UL 510 and Mil-I-24391.
4. Provide tape that remains flexible with abrasion resistance.
10. Splice the loop wire to loop lead-in cable only after the detector system has been tested and demonstrated under live traffic conditions. See standard detail drawings for splicing details.

# E. Inductance Loop Maintenance

1. Locate all existing loops, determine the operational status of all loop assemblies, and notify the Engineer prior to commencing loop construction activities at the intersection.
2. Maintain all existing, operational loops, unless otherwise notified by the Engineer. Repair of an existing, non-operational loop prior to beginning work will be considered as extra work.
3. Locate points of conflict between new loops and existing loops and install all new loops and saw cuts so as not to cut existing loop lead-ins and loop wires that are to be retained.
4. If an existing operational loop that is not scheduled for replacement fails during the construction time frame, notify the Engineer and complete the replacement of the damaged loops immediately.
5. Loops that are removed or destroyed as part of a construction, rehabilitation, or maintenance project shall be replaced and returned to full operation.
6. All costs associated with the replacement of the loops damaged during construction shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.

1945

# Section 937 — Detection Systems

# F. Inductance Loop Testing

1. Test each loop after installing the conductors in the slots cut in the pavement and before sealing.
2. Test the loop wire from the controller cabinet assembly spliced to the shielded lead-in wire.
3. If there are no splice points, such as in direct entry to the controller cabinet assembly, test wire at the cabinet.
4. Only perform the tests at the controller cabinet assembly.
5. Record the test results on the Loop Installation Data Sheet in Table 8. Make copies of the data sheet as needed.
6. Include the data sheets in the records and place a copy in the controller cabinet assembly.

# Section 937 — Detection Systems

Conduct the following tests to evaluate each inductance loop installation before sealing the loop in the pavement:

1. Induced AC Voltage Test: Read 0.05 VAC or less on a digital voltmeter or no deflection on the pointer of an analog meter.
2. Leakage Resistance to Ground: The resistance to ground shall be 5 MΩ or more.
3. Loop Resistance: The resistance reading on an ohmmeter is approximately within 10% of the calculated value. See Table 9 for wire resistance values.

Report to the Department an out-of-range reading on any of the above tests. If a test is unacceptable, remove and install new wire. Repeat the test procedure.

Include in the test results:

1. Type and model number of the equipment used (shall be ohmmeter having a high resistance scale of R x 10 kW or greater)
2. The last calibration date of the equipment and the scale used

Check the loop using an impedance tester to determine the natural operating frequency and impedance.

Verify that the completed units detect vehicles in accordance with prescribed accuracy requirements.

Loop Q

1. Q at 50 kHz is greater than 5.
